</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="xlarge">O</span><span class=
"allcaps">f</span> the objects of inquiry which engage our
attention the most, there are none, perhaps, that so much excite
continued curiosity, from childhood to age; none that the learned
and unlearned so equally wish to investigate, as the nature and
history of those parts of the world, which have not, to our
knowledge, been hitherto explored. To this desire the Voyages of
the late Captain Cook have so far afforded gratification, that
nothing worthy of research by Sea, the Poles themselves excepted,
remains to be examined; but by Land, the objects of Discovery are
still so vast, as to include at least a third of the habitable
surface of the earth: for much of Asia, a still larger proportion
of America, and almost the whole of Africa, are unvisited and
unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>In Asia there are
few extensive districts of which we are wholly ignorant; but there
are many of which we are imperfectly informed; and to our knowledge
of several of these, the expected publication of the Travels of Mr.
Forster, in the service of the East India Company, may bring
material improvement. For, about three years since, in returning
from Hindostan to Europe, he travelled by the way of Laldong,
Jummoo, Cashmire, Cabul, Herat, and the Caspian Sea; and though the
character of a Moorish Merchant, a disguise which the nature of the
journey compelled him to assume, would not permit him to depart so
far from the usage of Asia, as to make a draught of the country, or
to write any other than short memorandums as he passed, yet, if we
may judge from the opportunities he had of information, his
Narrative must be important. It will probably shew the manners and
customs, and military strength of the populous tribes that inhabit
the mountains on the North of Lahore: it promises to gratify the
eagerness which all men express to acquire a knowledge of the
sequestered and unexplored, though celebrated Country of Cashmire:
and there is reason to suppose, that it will also describe the
rising Empire of the Seiks, the conquerors of Zabeta Cawn, and the
rivals of Abdalla. Should this be the case, we shall learn the
history of an Empire that already extends<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_5">[5]</span> from the river Attok, the western branch of the
Indus, to the banks of the Jumma; and possibly too we may also be
told the particulars of a Religion, which, according to the
accounts received, professes to bring back the Hindoos from the
idolatrous veneration of images to the purity of their primitive
faith, the worship of One God: a Religion, which is said to ascribe
to its Founder, Nanock, who died about 200 years since, a sacred
character, by supposing that he was Brimha, and that this was his
last appearance upon earth: a Religion, which its Followers, in
contradiction to the former uniform practice of the Believers in
the Shaster, endeavour to make universal, and, with a zeal which
resembles the Mahometan, constantly enforce by the sword.</p>

<p>To our knowledge of America, a large and valuable addition may
soon be expected; for several of the inhabitants of Canada had the
spirit, about two years since, to send, at their own expence,
different persons to traverse that vast continent, from the river
St. Lawrence westward to the opposite ocean.</p>

<p>While, in this manner, the circle of our knowledge with respect
to Asia and America is gradually extending itself, and advancing
towards perfection, some progress has been made in<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> the discovery of particular parts
of Africa: for Dr. Sparman’s Narrative has furnished important
information, to which will soon be added that of Mr. Patterson,
whose account of his Travels and Observations in the Southern Parts
of Africa is already in the Press; and if a description of the
still more extended Travels of Colonel Gordon, the present
Commander of the Dutch Troops at the Cape of Good Hope, should be
given to the Public, the southern extremity of the African
peninsula may perhaps be justly considered as explored. Mr. Bruce
also, it is said, is preparing for the Press an account of the
knowledge which he has obtained on the eastern side of that quarter
of the globe.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the progress of discovery on the coasts and
borders of that vast continent, the map of its Interior is still
but a wide extended blank, on which the Geographer, on the
authority of Leo Africanus, and of the Xeriff Edrissi the Nubian
Author, has traced, with a hesitating hand, a few names of
unexplored rivers and of uncertain nations.</p>

<p>The course of the Niger, the places of its rise and termination,
and even its existence as a separate stream, are still
undetermined. Nor has our knowledge of the Senegal and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> Gambia rivers improved upon that
of De la Brue and Moore; for though since their time half a century
has elapsed, the Falls of Felu on the first of these two rivers,
and those of Baraconda on the last, are still the limits of
discovery.</p>

<p>Neither have we profited by the information which we have long
possessed, that even on the western coasts of Africa, the Mahometan
faith is received in many extensive districts, from the Tropic of
Cancer southward to the Line. That the Arabic, which the Mussulman
Priests of all countries understand, furnishes an easy access to
such knowledge as the western Africans are able to supply, is
perfectly obvious; as it also is, that those Africans must, from
the nature of their Religion, possess, what the Traders to the
coast ascribe to them, an intercourse with Mecca. But although
these circumstances apparently prove the practicability of
exploring the Interior Parts of Africa, and would much facilitate
the execution of the Plan, yet no such efforts have hitherto been
made. Certain however it is, that, while we continue ignorant of so
large a portion of the globe, that ignorance must be considered as
a degree of reproach upon the present age.</p>

<p>Sensible of this stigma, and desirous of rescuing the
age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> from a charge of
ignorance, which, in other respects, belongs so little to its
character, a few Individuals, strongly impressed with a conviction
of the practicability and utility of thus enlarging the fund of
human knowledge, have formed the Plan of an Association for
Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa.</p>

<p>The nature of their Establishment will best appear from the
following account of their proceedings.</p>

of three Assisting Members, be chosen by Ballot:</p>

<p>That the said Committee do prepare and submit to the
consideration of the Members, at their next meeting, such Rules as
they shall think requisite for the effectual attainment of the
object of the new Institution, and for its good government:</p>

<p>That the Committee be entrusted with the choice of the persons
who are to be sent on the Discovery of the Interior Parts of
Africa, together with the Society’s Correspondence, and the
Management of its Funds:</p>

<p>That the Committee shall not disclose, except to the Members of
the Association at large, such intelligence as they shall, from
time to time, receive from the persons who shall be sent out on the

endangering the object of their Association, be made public, shall
be communicated to the Meeting:</p>

<p>That an Account of all Monies paid and received shall, on the
last Saturday in the month of May in each year, be submitted to the

<p class="nind"><span class="xlarge">T</span><span class=

Interior Regions of Africa was formed on the 9th of June, in the
year 1788; and on the same day a Committee of its Members was
invested with the direction of its Funds, the management of its
Correspondence, and the choice of the persons to whom the
Geographical mission should be assigned.</p>

<p>Naturally anxious for the speedy attainment of the important
object thus recommended to their care, an object made doubly
interesting by the consideration of its having engaged the
attention, and baffled the researches of the most
inquisitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> and the
most powerful nations of antiquity, the Managers proceeded with the
utmost ardour to the immediate execution of the Plan.</p>

<p>Two Gentlemen, whose qualifications appeared to be eminent,
proposed to undertake the Adventure.</p>

<p>One of them, a Mr. <span class="gs">Ledyard</span>, was an
American by birth, and seemed from his youth to have felt an
invincible desire to make himself acquainted with the unknown, or
imperfectly discovered regions of the globe. For several years he
had lived with the Indians of America, had studied their manners,
and had practised in their school the means of obtaining the
protection, and of recommending himself to the favour of Savages.
In the humble situation of a Corporal of Marines, to which he
submitted rather than relinquish his pursuit, he had made, with
Captain Cook, the Voyage of the World; and feeling on his return an
anxious desire of penetrating from the North Western Coast of
America, which Cook had partly explored, to the Eastern Coast, with
which he himself was perfectly familiar, he determined to traverse
the vast Continent from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>His first Plan for
the purpose was that of embarking in a vessel which was then
preparing to sail, on a Voyage of Commercial Adventure, to Nootka
Sound, on the Western Coast of America; and with this view he
expended in sea stores, the greatest part of the money which his
chief benefactor Sir Joseph Banks (whose generous conduct the
Writer of this Narrative has often heard him acknowledge) had
liberally supplied. But the scheme being frustrated by the rapacity
of a Custom-house Officer, who had seized and detained the vessel
for reasons which on legal inquiry proved to be frivolous, he
determined to travel over land to Kamschatka, from whence to the
Western coast of America the passage is extremely short. With no
more than ten guineas in his purse, which was all that he had left,
he crossed the British Channel to Ostend, and by the way of Denmark
and the Sound, proceeded to the capital of Sweden, from whence, as
it was Winter, he attempted to traverse the Gulph of Bothnia on the
ice, in order to reach Kamschatka by the shortest way; but finding,
when he came to the middle of the sea, that the water was not
frozen, he returned to Stockholm, and taking his course Northward,
walked into the Arctic Circle; and passing round the head of the
Gulph, descended on its Eastern side to Petersburgh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>There, he was soon
noticed as an extraordinary man.—Without stockings, or shoes, and
in too much poverty to provide himself with either, he received and
accepted an invitation to dine with the Portugueze Ambassador. To
this invitation it was probably owing that he was able to obtain
the sum of twenty guineas for a bill on Sir Joseph Banks, which he
confessed he had no authority to draw, but which, in consideration
of the business that he had undertaken, and of the progress that he
had made, Sir Joseph, he believed, would not be unwilling to pay.
To the Ambassador’s interest it might also be owing that he
obtained permission to accompany a detachment of Stores which the
Empress had ordered to be sent to Yakutz, for the use of Mr.
Billings, an Englishman, at that time in her service.</p>

<p>Thus accommodated, he travelled Eastward through Siberia, six
thousand miles, to Yakutz, where he was kindly received by Mr.
Billings, whom he remembered on board Captain Cook’s ship, in the
situation of the Astronomer’s Servant, but to whom the Empress had
now entrusted her schemes of Northern discovery.</p>

<p>From Yakutz he proceeded to Oczakow, on the coast of the
Kamschatka sea, from whence he meant to have passed over
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> that peninsula,
and to have embarked on the Eastern side in one of the Russian
vessels that trade to the Western shores of America; but finding
that the navigation was completely obstructed by the ice, he
returned again to Yakutz, in order to wait for the conclusion of
the Winter.</p>

<p>Such was his situation, when, in consequence of suspicions not
hitherto explained, or resentments for which no reason is assigned,
he was seized, in the Empress’s name, by two Russian soldiers, who
placed him in a sledge, and conveying him, in the depth of Winter,
through the Deserts of the Northern Tartary, left him at last on
the Frontiers of the Polish Dominions. As they parted they told
him, that if he returned to Russia, he would certainly be hanged,
but that if he chose to go back to England, they wished him a
pleasant journey.</p>

<p>In the midst of poverty, covered with rags, infested with the
usual accompaniments of such cloathing, worn with continued
hardship, exhausted by disease, without friends, without credit,
unknown, and full of misery, he found his way to
Koningsberg.—There, in the hour of his uttermost distress, he
resolved once more to have recourse to his old Benefactor, and he
luckily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> found a
person who was willing to take his draft for five guineas on the
President of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>With this assistance he arrived in England, and immediately
waited on Sir Joseph Banks, who told him, knowing his temper, that
he believed he could recommend him to an adventure almost as
perilous as the one from which he had returned; and then
communicated to him the wishes of the Association for Discovering
the Inland Countries of Africa.</p>

<p><span class="gs">Ledyard</span> replied, that he had always
determined to traverse the Continent of Africa as soon as he had
explored the Interior of North America; and as Sir Joseph had
offered him a Letter of Introduction, he came directly to the
Writer of these Memoirs. Before I had learnt from the note the name
and business of my Visitor, I was struck with the manliness of his
person, the breadth of his chest, the openness of his countenance,
and the inquietude of his eye. I spread the map of Africa before
him, and tracing a line from Cairo to Sennar, and from thence
Westward in the latitude and supposed direction of the Niger, I
told him that was the route, by which I was anxious that Africa
might, if possible, be explored. He said, he should think himself
singularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> fortunate
to be entrusted with the Adventure. I asked him when he would set
out? “To-morrow morning,” was his answer. I told him I was afraid
that we should not be able, in so short a time, to prepare his
instructions, and to procure for him the letters that were
requisite; but that if the Committee should approve of his
proposal, all expedition should be used.</p>

<p>Such is the history, and such were the qualifications of one of
the persons whom the Committee engaged in its service.</p>

<p>The other, Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>, had been sent,
when a boy, to Cadiz, in Spain, for education as a merchant, and
having the misfortune on his return to be captured by a Sallee
Rover, was brought as a slave to the Imperial Court of Morocco.</p>

<p>Three years of captivity preceded his restoration to freedom,
and his consequent departure for Gibraltar; where, at the request
of General Cornwallis, he accepted the offices of Vice-Consul and
Chargé d’Affaires in the Empire of Morocco; and had the
satisfaction to return, as the Delegate of his Sovereign, to the
very kingdom in which, for so long a period, he had lived as a
slave. At the end of sixteen years he once more revisited England,
and was soon appointed Oriental Interpreter to the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> British Court, in which
situation he was when he became known to the Committee, and
expressed his willingness, with His Majesty’s permission, to
undertake, in the Service of the Association, whatever Journey his
knowlege of the Manners, Customs, and Language of the Arabs might
enable him to perform. His Majesty, with that liberal attention to
the Progress of Knowledge which at all times has distinguished his
reign, signified his pleasure, that Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span> should proceed on the business of the Society;
and that his salary as Oriental Interpreter should be continued to
him during his absence.</p>

<p>Having thus obtained the assistance of two persons so eminently
qualified to facilitate the attainment of its object, the Committee
proceeded to prescribe to them their respective routs.</p>

<p>To Mr. <span class="gs">Ledyard</span> they assigned, at his own
desire, as an enterprize of obvious peril and of difficult success,
the task of traversing from East to West, in the latitude
attributed to the Niger, the widest part of the Continent of
Africa.</p>

<p>To Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>, in consideration of the
knowledge which he possessed of the Language and Manners of the
Arabs, they allotted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the passage of the Desert of Zahara, from Tripoli to Fezzan; for
they had learned from various information, that with this kingdom,
which in some measure is dependent on Tripoli, the traders of
Agadez and Tombuctou, and of other towns in the Interior of Africa,
had established a frequent and regular intercourse; and their
instructions to him were, that he should proceed directly to
Fezzan; that he should collect and transmit by the way of Tripoli,
whatever intelligence, respecting the Inland Regions of the
Continent, the people of Fezzan, or the traders who visited their
country, might be able to afford; and that he should afterwards
return by the way of the Gambia, or by that of the Coast of
Guinea.</p>

<p>One obstacle to the departure of these Geographical Misionaries
was still to be removed; and that was, the smallness of the Fund;
for the Members of the Association, which had not yet passed the
second month of its existence, were extremely few, and the
Committee were too conscious of the importance and dignity of their
undertaking, to canvass for subscriptions.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, the Committee resolved to advance the money
that was requisite; and they accordingly raised among themselves
the sum of 430l. which enabled them to provide<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_22">[22]</span> for their travellers the means of
immediate equipment, and the letters of necessary credit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>, detained by illness, did not
leave England till the 6th of August.</p>

<p class="sch"><em>Mr.</em> <span class="gs">Ledyard</span>’<em>s
Arrival at Cairo. — His Remarks on the Inhabitants, &amp;c. — His
Death and Character.</em></p>

<hr class="decordb2 width25 space-below">

<p class="nind"><span class="xlarge">M</span><span class=
"allcaps">r.</span> <span class="gs">Ledyard</span> took his
departure from London on the 30th of June, 1788; and after a
journey of six and thirty days, seven of which were consumed at
Paris, and two at Marseilles, arrived in the city of
Alexandria.</p>

<p>His Letters of Recommendation to the British Consul secured him
from the embarrassments that the want of inns would<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> otherwise have occasioned; and
procured for him the necessary instructions for assuming the dress,
and adopting the manners that are requisite for an Egyptian
Traveller.</p>

<p>Forcibly impressed by the objects which he saw, and naturally
led to compare them with those which other Regions of the Globe had
presented to his view, he describes with the energy of an original
Observer, and exhibits in his Narrative the varied effect of
similarity and contrast: but as the travellers who preceded him,
have obtained and transmitted to Europe whatever knowledge, either
ancient or modern, the Lower Egypt affords, and as the examination
of that country was no part of the business which was given him in
charge, his descriptions, generally speaking, would add but little
to the instruction which other Narratives convey.</p>

<p>The following Extracts from different parts of his Journal are
given in his own words.</p>

<p>“A traveller, who should, by just comparisons between things
here and in Europe, tell his tale; who, by a mind unbewitched by
antecedent descriptions, too strong, too bold, too determined, too
honest, to be capable of lying, should speak just<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span> as he thought, would, no doubt,
be esteemed an arrant fool, and a stupid coxcomb.—For example, an
Englishman who had never seen Egypt, would ask me what sort of a
woman an Egyptian woman was? If I meant to do the question as much
justice by the answer, as I could in my way, I should ask him to
take notice of the first company of Gypsies he saw behind a hedge
in Essex; and I suppose he would be fool enough to think me a
fool.</p>

<p>“August 14th. I left Alexandria at midnight, with a pleasant
breeze North; and was, at sun-rise next morning, at the mouth of
the Nile, which has a bar of sand across it, and soundings as
irregular as the sea, which is raised upon it by the contentions of
counter currents and winds.</p>

<p>“The view in sailing up the Nile is very confined, unless from
the top of the mast, or some other eminence, and then it is an
unbounded plain of excellent land, miserably cultivated, and yet
interspersed with a great number of villages, both on its banks and
as far along the meadows as one can see in any direction: the river
is also filled with boats passing and repassing—boats all of one
kind, and navigated in one manner; nearly also of one size, the
largest carrying ten or fifteen tons. On board of these<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> boats are seen onions,
water-melons, dates, sometimes a horse, a camel, (which lies down
in the boat) and sheep and goats, dogs, men and women.—Towards
evening and morning they have music.</p>

<p>“Whenever we stopped at a village, I used to walk into it with
my Conductor, who, being a Musselman, and a descendant from
Mahommed, wore a green turban, and was therefore respected, and I
was sure of safety:—but in truth, dressed as I was in a common
Turkish habit, I believe I should have walked as safely without
him. I saw no propensity among the inhabitants to incivility. The
villages are most miserable assemblages of poor little mud huts,
flung very close together without any kind of order, full of dust,
lice, fleas, bed-bugs, flies, and all the curses of Moses: people
poorly clad, the youths naked; in such respects, they rank
infinitely below any Savages I ever saw.</p>

<p>“The common people wear nothing but a shirt and drawers, and
they are always blue. Green is the royal or holy colour; none but
the descendants of Mahommed, if I am rightly informed, being
permitted to wear it.</p>

<p>“August 19th. From the little town where we landed,
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> distance to Cairo
is about a mile and a half, which we rode on asses; for the ass in
this country is the Christian’s horse, as he is allowed no other
animal to ride upon. Indeed I find the situation of a Christian, or
what they more commonly call here a Frank, to be very, very
humiliating, ignominious, and distressing: no one, by a combination
of any causes, can reason down to such effects as experience
teaches us do exist here: it being impossible to conceive, that the
enmity I have alluded to could exist between men;—or, in fact, that
the same species of beings, from any causes whatever, should ever
think and act so differently as the Egyptians and the English
do.</p>

<p>“I arrived at Cairo early in the morning, on the 19th of August,
and went to the house of the Venetian Consul, Mr. Rosetti, Chargé
d’Affaires for the English Consul here.</p>

<p>“After dinner, not being able to find any other lodging, and
receiving no very pressing invitation from Mr. Rosetti, to lodge
with him, I went to a convent. This convent consists of
Missionaries sent by the Pope to propagate the Christian Faith, or
at least to give shelter to Christians. The Christians here are
principally from Damascus: the convent is governed by
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> Order of
Recollets: a number of English, as well as other European
travellers, have lodged there.</p>

<p>“August 21st. It is now about the hottest season of the year
here; but I think I have felt it warmer in the City of
Philadelphia, in the same month.</p>

<p>“August 26th. This day I was introduced by Rosetti to the Aga
Mahommed, the confidential Minister of Ismael, the most powerful of
the four ruling Beys: he gave me his hand to kiss, and with it the
promise of letters, protection, and support, through Turkish Nubia,
and also to some Chiefs far inland. In a subsequent conversation,
he told me I should see in my travels a people who had power to
transmutate themselves into the forms of different animals. He
asked me what I thought of the affair? I did not like to render the
ignorance, simplicity, and credulity of the Turk apparent. I told
him, that it formed a part of the character of all Savages to be
great Necromancers; but that I had never before heard of any so
great as those which he had done me the honour to describe; that it
had rendered me more anxious to be on my voyage, and if I passed
among them, I would, in the letter I promised to write to him, give
him a more particular account of them than he had hitherto had.—He
asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> me how I could
travel without the language of the people where I should pass? I
told him, with vocabularies:—I might as well have read to him a
page of Newton’s Principia. He returned to his fables again. Is it
not curious, that the Egyptians (for I speak of the natives of the
country as well as of him, when I make the observation) are still
such dupes to the arts of sorcery? Was it the same people who built
the Pyramids?</p>

<p>“I can’t understand that the Turks have a better opinion of our
mental powers than we have of theirs; but they say of us, that we
are “<em>a people who carry our minds on our fingers ends</em>:”
meaning, that we put them in exercise constantly, and render them
subservient to all manner of purposes, and with celerity, dispatch,
and ease, do what we do.</p>

<p>“I suspect the Copts to have been the origin of the Negro race:
the nose and lips correspond with those of the Negro. The hair,
whenever I can see it among the people here, (the Copts) is
curled;—not close like the Negros, but like the Mulattoes. I
observe a greater variety of colour among the human species here
than in any other country; and a greater variety of feature than in
any other country not possessing a greater degree of
civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“I have seen an
Abyssinian woman and a Bengal man—the colour is the same in both;
so are their features and persons.</p>

<p>“I have seen a small mummy;—it has what I call wampum work on
it. It appears as common here as among the Tartars. Tatowing is as
prevalent among the Arabs of this place as among the South Sea
Islanders. It is a little curious, that the women here are more
generally than in any other part of the world tatowed on the chin,
with perpendicular lines descending from the under lip to the chin,
like the women on the North West Coast of America. It is also a
custom here to stain the nails red, like the Cochin Chinese, and
the Northern Tartars. The mask or veil that the women here wear,
resembles exactly that worn by the Priests at Otaheite, and those
seen at Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>“I have not yet seen the Arabs make use of a tool like our axe
or hatchet; but what they use for such purposes as we do our
hatchet and axe, is in the form of an adze, and is a form we found
most agreeable to the South Sea Islanders. I see no instance of a
tool formed designedly for the use of the right or left hand
particularly, as the cotogon is among the Yorkertic Tartars.</p>

<p>“There is certainly a very remarkable affinity between
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> Russian and Greek
dress. The fillet round the temples of the Greek and Russian women,
is a circumstance in dress that perhaps would strike nobody as it
does me; and so of the wampum work too, which is also found among
them both.</p>

<p>“They spin here with the distaff and spindle only, like the
French peasantry and others in Europe; and the common Arab loom is
upon our principle, though rude.</p>

<p>“I saw to-day (August 10th) an Arab woman white, like the White
Indians in the South Sea Islands, Isthmus of Darien, &amp;c. These
kind of people all look alike.</p>

<p>“Among the Greek women here, I find the identical Archangel
head-dress.</p>

<p>“Their music is instrumental, consisting of a drum and pipe,
both which resemble those two instruments in the South Seas: the
drum is exactly like the Otaheite drum; the pipe is made of cane,
and consists of a long and short tube joined: the music resembles
very much the bagpipe, and is pleasant.—All their music is
concluded, if not accompanied, by the clapping of hands. I think it
singular, that the women here make a noise with their<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> mouths like frogs, and that this
frog-music is always made at weddings; and I believe on all other
occasions of merriment where there are women.</p>

<p>“It is remarkable, that the dogs here are of just the same
species found among the Otaheiteans.</p>

<p>“It is also remarkable, that in one village I saw exactly the
same machines used for diversion as in Russia.—I forget the Russian
name for it. It is a large kind of wheel, on the extremities of
which there are suspended seats, in which people are whirled round
over and under each other.</p>

<p>“The women dress their hair behind exactly in the same manner in
which the women of the Calmuc Tartars dress theirs.</p>

<p>“In the History of the Kingdom of Benin in Guinea, the Chiefs
are called Aree Roee, or Street Kings. Among the Islands in the
South Sea, Otaheite, &amp;c. they call the Chiefs Arees, and the
great Chiefs Aree le Hoi. I think this curious; and so I do that it
is a custom of the Arabs to spread a blanket when they would invite
any one to eat or rest with them.—American Indians spread the
beaver skins on such occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“The Arabs of the
Deserts, like the Tartars, have an invincible attachment to
Liberty: no arts will reconcile them to any other life, or form of
government, however modified. This is a character given me here of
the Arabs.</p>

<p>“It is singular that the Arab Language has no word for Liberty,
although it has for Slaves.</p>

<p>“The Arabs, like the New Zealanders, engage with a long strong
spear.</p>

<p>“I have made the best inquiries I have been able, since I have
been here, of the nature of the country before me; of Sennar,
Darfoor, Wangara, of Nubia, Abyssinia, of those named, or unknown
by name. I should have been happy to have sent you better
information of those places than I am yet able to do. It will
appear very singular to you in England, that we in Egypt are so
ignorant of countries which we annually visit: the Egyptians know
as little of Geography as the generality of the French; and like
them, sing, dance, and traffic without it.</p>

<p>“I have the best assurances of a certain and safe conduct by the
return of the caravan that is arrived from Sennar; and
Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> Rosetti tells me
that the letters I shall have from the Aga here, will insure me of
being conveyed, from hand to hand, to my journey’s end.</p>

<p>“The Mahometans in Africa are what the Russians are in Siberia,
a trading, enterprizing, superstitious, warlike set of vagabonds,
and wherever they are set upon going, they will and do go; but they
neither can nor do make voyages merely commercial, or merely
religious, across Africa; and where we do not find them in
commerce, we find them not at all. They cannot (however vehemently
pushed on by religion) afford to cross the Continent without
trading by the way.</p>

<p>“October 14th. I went to-day to the market-place, where they
vend the Black slaves that come from towards the interior parts of
Africa:—there were 200 of them together, dressed and ornamented as
in their country. The appearance of a Savage in every region is
almost the same!—There were very few men among them: this indicates
that they are prisoners of war. They have a great many beads and
other ornaments about them that are from the East. I was told by
one of them that they came from the West of Sennar, fifty-five days
journey, which may be about four or five hundred miles. A Negro
Chief said, the Nile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
had its source in his country. In general they had their hair
plaited in a great number of small detached plaits, none exceeding
in length six or eight inches—the hair was filled with grease, and
dirt purposely daubed on.</p>

<p>“October 16th. I have renewed my visit to-day, and passed it
more agreeably than yesterday; for yesterday I was rudely treated.
The Franks are prohibited to purchase slaves, and therefore the
Turks do not like to see them in the market. Mr. Rosetti favoured
me with one of his running Chargé d’Affaires to accompany me: but
having observed yesterday among the ornaments of the Negros a
variety of beads, and wanting to know from what country they came,
I requested Mr. Rosetti, previously to my second visit, to shew me
from his store samples of Venetian beads.—He shewed me samples of
fifteen hundred different kinds: after this I set out.</p>

<p>“The name of the country these Savages come from is Darfoor, and
is well known on account of the Slave Trade, as well as of that in
Gum and Elephants teeth.</p>

<p>“The appearance of these Negros declares them to be a people in
as savage a state as any people can; but not of so
savage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> a temper, or
of that species of countenance that indicates savage intelligence.
They appear a harmless, wild people; but they are mostly young
women.</p>

<p>“The beads they are ornamented with are Venetian; and they have
some Venetian brass medals which the Venetians make for trade. The
beads are worked wampum-wise. I know not where they got the marine
shells they worked among their beads, nor how they could have seen
white men. I asked them if they would use me well in their country,
if I should visit it? They said, “Yes:”—and added, that they should
make a King of me, and treat me with all the delicacies of their
country. Like the Egyptian women, and like most other Savages, they
stick on ornaments wherever they can, and wear, like them, a great
ring in the nose, either from the cartilage, or from the side: they
also rub on some black kind of paint round the eyes, like the
Egyptian women. They are a sizeable well-formed people, quite
black, with what, I believe, we call the true Guinea face, and with
curled short hair; but not more curled or shorter than I have seen
it among the Egyptians; but in general these Savages plait it in
tassels plaistered with clay or paint. Among some of them the hair
is a foot long, and curled, resembling exactly one of our mops. The
prevailing colour, where it can be seen, is a black and
red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> mixed. I think it
would make any hair curl, even Uncle Toby’s wig, to be plaited and
plaistered as this is. This caravan, which I call the Darfoor
caravan, is not very rich.—The Sennar is the rich caravan.</p>

<p>“October 19th. I went yesterday to see if more of the Darfoor
caravan had arrived; but they were not. I wonder why travellers to
Cairo have not visited these slave markets, and conversed with the
Jelabs or travelling Merchants of these caravans: both are
certainly sources of great information.—The eighth part of the
money expended on other accounts, might here answer some good solid
purpose. For my part, I have not expended a crown, and I have a
better idea of the people of Africa, of its trade, of the position
of places, the nature of the country, manner of travelling, &amp;c.
than ever I had by any other means; and, I believe, better than any
other means would afford me.</p>

<p>“October 25th. I have been again to the slave market; but
neither the Jelabs (a name which in this country is given to all
travelling Merchants) nor the slaves are yet arrived in town—they
will be here to-morrow. I met two or three in the street, and one
with a shield and spear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“I have understood
to-day, that the King of Sennar is himself a Merchant, and
concerned in the Sennar caravans. The Merchant here who contracts
to convey me to Sennar, is Procurer at Cairo to the King of Sennar:
this is a good circumstance, and one I knew not of till to-day. Mr.
Rosetti informed me of it. He informed me also, that this year the
importation of Negro Slaves into Egypt will amount to 20,000.—The
caravans from the interior countries of Africa do not arrive here
uniformly every year—they are sometimes absent two or three
years.</p>

<p>“Among a dozen of Sennar slaves, I saw three personable men, of
a good bright olive colour, of vivacious and intelligent
countenances; but they had all three (which fist attracted my
notice) heads uncommonly formed: the forehead was the narrowest,
the longest, and most protuberant I ever saw. Many of these slaves
speak a few words of the Arab language; but whether they learned
them before or since their captivity I cannot tell.</p>

<p>“A caravan goes from here (Cairo) to Fezzan, which they call a
journey of fifty days; and from Fezzan to Tombuctou, which they
call a journey of ninety days. The caravans travel<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> about twenty miles a day, which
makes the distance on the road from here to Fezzan, one thousand
miles; and from Fezzan to Tombuctou, one thousand eight hundred
miles. From here to Sennar is reckoned six hundred miles.</p>

<p>“I have been waiting several days to have an interview with the
Jelabs who go from hence to Sennar. I am told that they carry, in
general, trinkets; but among other things, soap, antimony, red
linen, razors, scissars, mirrors, beads; and, as far as I can yet
learn, they bring from Sennar elephants teeth, the gum called here
gum Sennar, camels, ostrich feathers, and slaves.</p>

<p>“Wangara is talked of here as a place producing much gold, and
as a kingdom: all accounts, and there are many, agree in this. The
King of Wangara (whom I hope to see in about three months after
leaving this) is said to dispose of just what quantity he pleases
of his gold—sometimes a great deal, and sometimes little or none;
and this, it is said, he does to prevent strangers knowing how rich
he is, and that he may live in peace.”</p>

<p>Such are the most material of those remarks on the people of
Africa, which Mr. <span class="gs">Ledyard</span> was enabled, by
his residence at Cairo, to send to the Committee.—The views which
they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> opened were
interesting and instructive; but they derived their principal
importance from the proofs which they afforded of the ardent spirit
of inquiry, the unwearied attention, the persevering research, and
the laborious, indefatigable, anxious zeal with which their Author
pursued the object of his Mission.</p>

<p>Already informed that his next dispatch would be dated from
Sennar; that letters of earnest recommendation had been given him
by the Aga; that the terms of his passage had been settled; and
that the day of his departure was appointed—the Committee expected
with impatience the description of his journey. Great was therefore
their concern, and severe their disappointment, when letters from
Egypt announced to them the melancholy tidings of his death. A
bilious complaint, the consequence of vexatious delays in the
promised departure of the caravan, had induced him to try the
effect of too powerful a dose of the acid of vitriol; and the
sudden uneasiness and burning pain which followed the incautious
draught, impelled him to seek relief from the violent action of the
strongest Tartar emetic. A continued discharge of blood discovered
the danger of his situation, and summoned to his aid the generous
friendship of the Venetian Consul, and the ineffectual skill of the
most approved physicians of Cairo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>He was decently
interred in the neighbourhood of such of the English as had ended
their days in the capital of Egypt.</p>

<p>The bilious complaint with which he was seized has been
attributed to the frowardness of a childish impatience—Much more
natural is the conjecture, that his unexpected detention, week
after week, and month after month, at Cairo, (a detention which
consumed his finances, which therefore exposed to additional hazard
the success of his favourite enterprize, and which consequently
tended to bring into question his honour to the Society) had
troubled his spirits, had preyed upon his peace, and subjected him
at last to the disease that proved in its consequences the means of
dragging him to his grave.</p>

<p>Of his attachment to the Society, and of his zeal for their
service, the following Extracts from his Letters are remarkably
expressive:</p>

<p>“Money! it is a vile slave!—I have at present an œconomy of a
more exalted kind to observe. I have the eyes of some of the first
men of the first kingdom on earth turned upon me. I am engaged by
those very men, in the most important object that any private
individual can be engaged in: I have their approbation<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> to acquire, or to lose; and
their esteem also, which I prize beyond every thing, except the
independent idea of serving mankind. Should rashness or desperation
carry me through, whatever fame the vain and injudicious might
bestow, I should not accept of it;—it is the good and great I look
to: fame from them bestowed is altogether different, and is closely
allied to a well-done from God: but rashness will not be likely to
carry me through any more than timid caution. To find the necessary
medium of conduct, to vary and apply it to contingencies, is the
œconomy I allude to; and if I succeed by such means, men of sense
in any succeeding epoch will not blush to follow me, and perfect
those Discoveries I have only abilities to trace out roughly, or, a
disposition to attempt.</p>

<p>“A Turkish sopha has no charms for me: if it had, I could soon
obtain one here. I could to-morrow take the command of the best
armament of Ishmael Bey.—I should be sure of success, and its
consequential honours. Believe me, a single well-done from your
Association has more worth in it to me, than all the trappings of
the East; and what is still more precious, is, the pleasure I have
in the justification of my own conduct at the tribunal of my own
heart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>To those who have
never seen Mr. <span class="gs">Ledyard</span>, it may not,
perhaps, be uninteresting to know, that his person, though scarcely
exceeding the middle size, was remarkably expressive of activity
and strength; and that his manners, though unpolished, were neither
uncivil nor unpleasing. Little attentive to difference of rank, he
seemed to consider all men as his equals, and as such he respected
them. His genius, though uncultivated and irregular, was original
and comprehensive. Ardent in his wishes, yet calm in his
deliberations; daring in his purposes, but guarded in his measures;
impatient of controul, yet capable of strong endurance; adventurous
beyond the conception of ordinary men, yet wary and considerate,
and attentive to all precautions, he appeared to be formed by
Nature for atchievements of hardihood and peril.</p>

<p>They who compare the extent of his pilgrimage through the vast
regions of Tartary with the scantiness of his funds, will naturally
ask, by what means he obtained a subsistence on the road? All that
I have ever learned from him on the subject, was, that his
sufferings were excessive, and that more than once he owed his life
to the compassionate temper of the women. This last remark is
strongly confirmed by the following Extract from his account of his
Siberian Tour:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“I have always
remarked, that women, in all countries, are civil, obliging,
tender, and humane; that they are ever inclined to be gay and
chearful, timorous and modest; and that they do not hesitate, like
men, to perform a generous action.—Not haughty, not arrogant, not
supercilious, they are full of courtesy, and fond of society: more
liable, in general, to err than man; but in general, also, more
virtuous, and performing more good actions than he. To a woman,
whether civilized or savage, I never addressed myself in the
language of decency and friendship, without receiving a decent and
friendly answer. With man it has often been otherwise.</p>

<p>“In wandering over the <em>barren</em> plains of
<em>inhospitable Denmark</em>, through <em>honest Sweden</em>, and
<em>frozen Lapland</em>, <em>rude</em> and <em>churlish
Finland</em>, <em>unprincipled Russia</em>, and the <em>wide spread
regions</em> of the <em>wandering Tartar</em>, if hungry, dry,
cold, wet, or sick, the women have ever been friendly to me, and
uniformly so; and to add to this virtue, (so worthy the appellation
of benevolence) these actions have been performed in so free, and
so kind a manner, that if I was dry, I drank the sweetest draught,
and if hungry, I eat the coarse morsel with a double relish.”</p>

<p>But though the native benevolence, which even among
Savages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> distinguishes
and adorns the female character, might sometimes soften the
severity of his sufferings, yet at others he seems to have endured
the utmost pressure of distress.</p>

<p>“I am accustomed—(said he, in our last conversation—’twas on the
morning of his departure for Africa)—I am accustomed to hardships.
I have known both hunger and nakedness to the utmost extremity of
human suffering. I have known what it is to have food given me as
charity to a madman; and I have at times been obliged to shelter
myself under the miseries of that character to avoid a heavier
calamity. My distresses have been greater than I have ever owned,
or ever <em>will</em> own to any man. Such evils are terrible to
bear; but they never yet had power to turn me from my purpose. If I
live, I will faithfully perform, in its utmost extent, my
engagement to the Society; and if I perish in the attempt, my
<em>honour</em> will still be safe, for death cancels all
bonds.”</p>

<hr class="decordb2 width25 space-below">

<p class="nind"><span class="xlarge">M</span><span class=
"allcaps">r. Lucas</span>, having taken his passage at Marseilles,
on board the St. Jean Baptiste, a small vessel belonging to that
port, embarked on the 18th of October, 1788; and on the 25th of the
same month arrived in the harbour of Tripoli.</p>

<p>The date trees, which spread themselves like a forest behind the
town, and the hills beyond them, which bound the
prospect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> on the
South, are interesting objects; but the town itself is built in too
low a situation to compose a part of the general scene: for it is
scarcely visible at the distance of a mile.</p>

<p>The first appearance of Tripoli may disappoint, by its meanness,
the expectations of the traveller; but if he reflects on the nature
of a despotic government, ever incompatible with permanent
prosperity, he will not be surprized when he finds, on a nearer
view, that the city, though the capital of an empire, exhibits
through all its extent, the marks of a rapid decay; that its scanty
limits, though scarcely four miles in circumference, are too great
for its present population; and that its antient castle, though
once the pride, and still the residence, of the reigning family, is
now a mouldering ruin.</p>

<p>The expected ceremonial of announcing to the Bashaw, which is
the title of the Sovereign, and to the Consul of the State, to whom
the vessel belongs, her arrival in the harbour, having been
regularly observed, Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>, accompanied
by Mr. Tully, the British Resident, waited on Hadgee Abdrahaman,
the Tripoline Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had formerly
resided in England as Ambassador from the Bashaw; and having known
Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> there, received him now with the
joy of an old acquaintance,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_49">[49]</span> and the cordiality of an intimate friend.
Encouraged by this kindness, Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>
explained to him the object of his mission, and requested that he
would present and recommend him to the Bashaw, and to the Prince,
his eldest son, who is distinguished by the title of the Bey. The
Minister consented; and the next morning was, accordingly,
appointed by the Bashaw for the first of these audiences: the
morning after was fixed on by the Bey for the latter.</p>

<p>The Bashaw, a short and robust old man, of a fair complexion, a
pleasing countenance, and an affable, joyous disposition, received
Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> with great complacency, and
accepted, with much satisfaction, his present of a pair of
double-barrelled pistols, mounted with silver; but expressed his
surprize, when leave was asked to visit his kingdom of Fezzan: for
the journey, he said, had never been attempted by a Christian. Mr.
<span class="gs">Lucas</span> replied, that he was led to undertake
it by the report which he had heard of various Roman antiquities in
different parts of the kingdom, and by the hope of collecting a
variety of medicinal plants that are not to be found in Europe. The
Bashaw appeared to be satisfied, and promised that, on the first
opportunity of a safe conveyance, he would give him such aids for
the journey as his countenance and protection could afford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>On the next
morning Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> was presented to the Bey,
the Bashaw’s eldest son, a tall and well shaped, but dark
complexioned man, in the middle period of life; and was received by
him with the engaging politeness for which he is eminently
distinguished. The present that was made to him, except that its
value was inferior, was similar to that which had been given to his
father; and the assurances of the protection and friendship, which
he offered in return, were the same in effect with those which the
Bashaw had expressed.</p>

<p>Soon after his presentation at Court, Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span> was informed that some of the principal Tribes of
the tributary Arabs had lately revolted from the Government, and
were then in actual rebellion; that all the frontiers of Tripoli,
on the side of the Desert, were infested by their inroads; that a
caravan from the inland country had lately been attacked, and that
a Spanish Merchant had been plundered within a few miles of the
Capital. Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> was also informed, that
the Bashaw, who has no regular forces, was preparing to raise, on
this occasion, an army of 2,000 men; that as soon as the grass
should be high enough to afford the necessary forage for the
cattle, which it would be in the month of December, they would
begin their march to the frontier, where<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_51">[51]</span> they would be joined by the troops of such of
the Arabs as continued faithful to the Government.</p>

<p>With this army, the collective numbers of which were expected to
amount to five or six thousand men, it was hoped that the Bey, by
the usual enforcements of predatory war, would be able to reduce
the rebellious Tribes to their antient obedience, and to the
payment of the customary tribute.</p>

<p>But while, from this expectation, Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span> waited with impatience for the departure of the
army, he was informed that two Shereefs from Fezzan, who were both,
as their title announces, descended from the Prophet, and one of
whom had married the daughter of the King, were arrived in Tripoli.
They came there as Merchants, and brought with them, for sale, a
variety of articles, of which slaves and senna were the chief; and
as the reverence in which the descendants of Mahomet are held
secures their persons from violence, and their property from
plunder, they did not think that the restoration of peace was
requisite for the safety of their return. It was, therefore, with
much satisfaction that the Minister, whose intimate acquaintance
they were, received from them an assurance, that if Mr.
<span class="gs">Lucas</span> could bear the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_52">[52]</span> fatigue of the journey, they would take
him under their protection, and would be answerable for his safe
arrival in Fezzan.</p>

<p>The next morning, in consequence of this conversation, the
Shereefs waited upon Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>. One of
them, whose rank as son-in-law to the King, entitled him to the
first consideration, was a tall, thin, copper complexioned man, of
too slender a frame for his height, which was nearly six feet, but
of an appearance that was expressive of dignity: to this appearance
the sedateness of his manners, and the fewness, but solidity of his
words were particularly suited. His age was seemingly about
thirty-five years, and his name was Mohammed Bensein Hassen Fouwad.
The other Shereef was a lively old man, short and thin, and dark
coloured, almost to blackness; affable, free, and entertaining in
his conversation, and much respected by his companion, to whom he
was related. His name was Imhammed, and his age about fifty
years.</p>

<p>After many compliments, for which their countrymen are famous,
they expressed to Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> the pleasure
they should feel in presenting him to their King, who had never
seen a Christian Traveller, and would be highly gratified by so new
a visit. They assured him of every accommodation which their
country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> could afford,
and of every proof which they themselves could give of the kindest
good will, and of the sincerest friendship. The conference was
concluded by a present from Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> of a
pair of pistols to each, with a suitable quantity of powder and
ball, and flints.</p>

<p>The Bashaw, being informed by the Minister of the proposal and
promises of the Shereefs, expressed his approbation of the scheme,
and sent, from his own stables, as a present to Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span>, a handsome mule for the journey. The Bey, too,
was no sooner acquainted with the arrangements, than he gave
directions to a Jew taylor, who had been employed in making, and
had just finished his own tent, to wait upon Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span>, and take his orders for such a tent as would be
requisite for his journey.</p>

<p>But while in this manner Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> was
preparing for his departure, and had bespoke a Turkish dress for
himself, and a magnificent robe, as a present, for the King of
Fezzan, an apprehension arose in the mind of the Bashaw, that if
Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> should be taken prisoner by the
Rebels, he himself should be reduced to the distressing dilemma of
either concluding a disadvantageous peace, or of abandoning the
Interpreter of the King of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_54">[54]</span> Great Britain to all the insults, and to all
the cruelties which those Barbarians might be disposed to
inflict.</p>

<p>For this reason, the force of which will be much more apparent,
if the respect in which the office of Interpreter in a Mahometan
Government is usually held, be considered, he expressed his desire
(and in this desire his eldest son, the Bey, entirely concurred)
that Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> would defer his intended
journey till the revolted Arabs should be reduced to obedience, and
the peace of the Desert be restored. A few days after this
requisition, the Bey began his march with an army of 300 horse and
1500 foot.</p>

<p>The Shereefs were no sooner informed of the obstacle which had
arisen to the journey of their intended fellow-traveller, than they
expressed as much chagrin and disappointment as Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span> himself could feel; for they said, that they had
already sent word to their Sovereign, that they should soon have
the pleasure to present to him a Christian, who had travelled from
his native land, (a journey of many moons) with no other view than
to gratify his wish to visit him, and to see his kingdom of
Fezzan:—that his anger would fall heavily on them, to whom he would
attribute the disappointment; and would probably lead<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> him to inflict on them the
greatest indignity that Shereefs can endure, that of having dust
heaped upon their heads.</p>

<p>Impressed with these apprehensions, the Shereefs waited upon the
Bashaw, and offered to be responsible with their lives for the
safety of the Christian.</p>

<p>In this unfavourable state of Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span>’s prospects, an old man of the class of Maraboots
(a name which is given to persons of distinguished sanctity)
informed the Minister, with whom he had been long acquainted, that
he meant, in a few days, to take his departure for Fezzan; and that
as the Rebels, in consequence of the march of the Bashaw’s forces,
had removed from that part of the country through which he intended
to pass, he would engage that, under his conduct, Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span> should travel in safety.</p>

<p>With this proposal Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>, by the
advice of the Minister, and with the consent of the Bashaw, had
determined to comply, though against his own opinion, for the
countenance and behaviour of the Maraboot had suggested suspicions
of his sincerity; but while he was preparing for his departure,
which was fixed for the Monday following, the Bashaw, on further
reflection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> concluded
that the plan which the Shereefs had proposed would, on the whole,
be attended with the smallest hazard.</p>

<p>The scheme of the journey being thus finally settled, the
Bashaw, at the request of the Minister, presented Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span> with a letter of recommendation to the King of
Fezzan, of which the following is a translation.</p>

<hr class="decordb1 width20 spaced2">

<h3><em>TRANSLATION OF THE BASHAW OF TRIPOLI’<span class=
"med">S</span> RECOMMENDATION OF M<sup>R.</sup> LUCAS TO THE KING
OF FEZZAN.</em>

<hr class="decordb2 width20 spaced2">

<p>“Praise be unto the Almighty God, and unto our Lord his Prophet
Mahommed, whose protection and mercy we crave, and resign ourselves
to his holy will: to our Son Sydy Hamed Benmohamed, the great and
just ruler over his beloved people; may his days be long and happy.
Amen.</p>

<p>“Peace, and the protection and blessing of God, be with you, and

<p>“We have to acquaint you, our son, that our friend, the English
King, hath sent one of his Interpreters unto us, and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> desired we would procure him a
safe conveyance to Fezzan, where he goes for his own amusement and
pleasure; and as we have found a person whom we esteem, and who has
promised us to take great care of him, we have consented to let the
said Interpreter and his friends<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href=

have to desire that you will shew him and his friends every
kindness in your power, and comply with all his wishes; and should
he be inclined to go to any other place, you will send proper
people to conduct him, and to protect him in every thing; for he is
a man of sense, and much esteemed by us; wherefore we recommend him
to your care and protection. Peace and the blessing of God be with
you: from the Slave of God, Ally Benkaramaly, whose greatness is
under the protection of God. Dated in the Moon of Rabeah thénee

<hr class="decordb2 width20 spaced2">

<p>To this rout by Mesurata, though not so direct as the antient
passage by the way of the Mountains of Guariano, the Merchants who
trade to Fezzan have lately given the preference: for in the first
place, they avoid the oppressive contributions, which,
even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> in time of
peace, the rapacious tribes of Hooled Bensoliman and Benioleed, who
inhabit those hills, have often levied on travellers; and in the
next place, they have not only the advantage of sending their heavy
merchandize to Mesurata by sea, but have also an opportunity of
hiring there, at a much lower rate than at Tripoli, the camels for
which they have occasion.</p>

<p>On Sunday the first of February, 1789, at half an hour after
eight in the morning, the Shereefs, accompanied by Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span>, took their departure from the suburbs of
Tripoli, where, in a garden which is situated at the distance of
three miles from the town, and which belonged to a Tripoline
Merchant, who was travelling with them to Fezzan, they and their
attendants had slept the evening before.</p>

<p>The caravan was composed of the Shereef Fouwad, and of three
other Merchants, on horseback, all of them well armed; of the
little old Shereef, who rode upon an ass; of Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span>, who was mounted on the mule which the Bashaw had
given him; of Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>’s black servant,
well armed, upon a camel; of twelve Fezzaners on foot, but armed;
of three Negros and their wives, who had been slaves at Tripoli,
but having obtained their freedom, were now travelling to Fezzan on
their return to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> their
native country; and of twenty-one camels, with fifteen drivers,
each of whom was armed with a musket and a pistol.</p>

<p>That so few camels were requisite in this part of the journey,
was owing to the expedient which the Shereefs, with great œconomy,
had adopted, of sending their heavy merchandize by sea to
Mesurata.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock, the caravan, whose course was E.S.E. passed
through the town of Tajarah, a miserable collection of clay-walled
huts, of which some were covered with terrace, and the rest with
roofs of thatch: but wretched as the buildings are, the country
around them abounds with date trees, among which a few of the olive
are intermixed.</p>

<p>At five the caravan encamped for the night upon a sandy
eminence. No sooner were the camels unburthened of their loads,
than their drivers turned them loose to feed on the stubble of the
valleys, and on the brambles of the adjacent hills; but though
their freedom is thus given them, they never stray to a greater
distance than that of two or three hundred paces from the camp.</p>

<p>The loads in the mean time are piled in a circle, and, except at
the narrow opening which forms the entrance, are stowed
as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> close as possible
to each other. Within this circle the Merchants and drivers and
servants spread their mats and carpets. Here, also, they light
their fires and dress their victuals; and without any other
covering than their alhaiques or blankets (for very few are
furnished with a tent) lie down amidst the heavy dews and
occasional storms of rain that fall upon the coast, and sleep as
soundly as in a bed: for the wetness of their cloaths, which is
often the consequence of this exposure, is little regarded, and
from the salubrity of the climate, is attended with little
inconvenience.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>’s tent being spread, the two
Shereefs, with three of their friends, took up their quarters with
him: and on the first appearance of supper, which was served in a
large wooden dish, and consisted of dried meat, and of flour formed
into balls, and dressed in steam, they all sat down with the
familiarity of near relations, and dipping their right hands into
the dish, without either spoons or forks or knives, devoured, with
a voracious and disgusting haste, the whole that was set before
them.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the meal was followed by the ceremony of
washing, which consisted in each man’s dipping his right hand into
the same water which his companions had used. Coffee being then
brought in, they lighted their pipes, and each of them<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> having drank three or four
dishes as he smoaked, they laid themselves down in their cloaths,
upon the bare sand, and conversed together till they talked
themselves to sleep.</p>

<p>February 2d. The next morning, at day-break, the drivers began
to re-load the camels: at eight o’clock the caravan was again in
motion; from which time till half an hour after four, they
travelled amidst dreary hills of loose and barren sand, where they
saw neither man nor beast, neither wood nor water.</p>

<p>A small valley between the hills, from which, to their great
annoyance, the shifting sand was continually blown down upon them,
was the place of their encampment; a place entirely destitute of
water, but from this circumstance they felt no sort of
inconvenience, as they had brought with them, in goat skins, an
ample store.</p>

<p>February 3d. At half an hour after seven in the morning, they
proceeded on their journey, and having emerged from the sand hills
about two in the afternoon, were charmed with the sight of olive
and of date trees, of large quantities of white thorn, and of the
Spanish broom; yet the soil is dry and stoney, and the few fields
of grain which present themselves here and there to the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> eye, exhibit in their scanty and
meagre appearance, the marks of an ungracious and sullen
vegetation.</p>

<p>On the right or S.E. of their road, at the distance of about
twenty miles, the mountains of Guariano and Misselata rise upon the
view.—A sight that recals to the mind of the experienced Traveller,
and leads him to relate to the stranger, the beauty of the vales,
the richness of the lands, abounding in corn and oil, and the
fierce inhospitable disposition of the inhabitants, that compels
the caravan to turn from their dominions, its direct and antient
road, and to take its course among the desolate hills, and dreary
wastes of the sandy and barren coast.<a id=
"FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>A request from the
Shereef Fouwad was now made to Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>
for his consent to encamp that evening in the neighbourhood of an
old Arab, his particular friend, with whom he had business to
transact, but whose residence was two hours march to the South of
their road. They accordingly turned to the South, and about five
o’clock, after a tedious and difficult passage among rocky hills,
they approached the tents of the Arab. The old gentleman,
accompanied by his two sons and a few attendants, came forward to
meet them; and after expressing great satisfaction at the sight of
his friend, the Shereef, he ordered a tent to be cleared for their
reception, and in the mean time conducted them to a mat and carpet,
which his servants had spread for them under a hedge; for,
notwithstanding the season of the year, the heat was already
troublesome. They had not been seated long when their host invited
them to their tent, in which a number of mats and carpets were
neatly laid.—A sheep was killed, and sent to be dressed for their
suppers; bowls of buttermilk were brought for their present
refreshment, and barley in abundance was given to such of their
cattle as were accustomed to that kind of food; while the camels,
as usual, were sent to feed among the hills.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock the supper was brought to the tent, and
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> placed before
them in two large wooden dishes. Of these the first contained the
mutton, which was boiled, and cut into small pieces: the other was
filled with a boiled paste of dried barley meal, made up in the
form of an English pudding, and surrounded with a great quantity of
oil. This dish, which was intended as an accompaniment to the
mutton, and which is in much estimation at Tripoli, is called
bazeen.</p>

<p>While Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> tasted of the last, and
eat with pleasure of the first of these dishes, and the Fezzaners,
with their usual dispatch, were devouring the contents of both, the
old man and his sons stood by to supply them with water and
buttermilk; for the rules of the Arab hospitality require, that
during their meals the master of the house should wait upon his
guests.</p>

<p>Feb. 4th. The next morning, at seven o’clock, the entertainment
was repeated, with the same marks of a kind and liberal welcome;
for the old man is rich in corn and cattle, and having obtained the
character of a Musselman Saint, or Maraboot, is, on that account,
exempted from the payment of taxes.</p>

<p>After a march of three hours, during which the rout was
perplexed, and the eye fatigued by a continued succession of
rocky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> hills, the
caravan arrived at the entrance of an extensive and beautiful
plain, that every where exhibited a luxuriant growth of olive
trees, intermixed with dates.</p>

<p>The next two hours brought them to the sea coast, and to all
that now exists of the town of Lebida, where, in the ruins of a
temple, and in the much more perfect remains of several triumphal
arches, the Traveller contemplates the magnificence of an antient
Roman colony; and discovers, in the beauty and fertile appearance
of the adjoining plain, the reasons which led them to chuse, for a
sea-port town, a situation that furnishes no natural harbour.</p>

<p>Eastward of the ruins, for about five and twenty miles, the
soil, though entirely unaided by the poor Arabs who inhabit it,
exhibits the same luxuriant vegetation; and the scene is rendered
still more interesting by the remains of a stupendous aqueduct,
which formerly conveyed to Lebida the water of a distant hill.</p>

<p>At half an hour after five, and in the neighbourhood of a
miserable village, the caravan encamped for the night.</p>

<p>Feb. 5th. The next day’s journey, which was attended with
nothing remarkable, and during which they followed the
line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> of the coast,
brought them to Zuleteen, an inconsiderable town, where they found
that a boat, to which a part of their baggage was intrusted, had
been compelled by a storm to deposit her cargo. From this
circumstance, and the necessity which followed it, of hiring six
additional camels for their goods, the departure of the caravan on
the next day (February 6th) was retarded till two o’clock in the
afternoon. At the end of the first hour’s march, they were informed
by some friendly Arabs, who were moving their tents and cattle, for
the sake of protection, to the suburbs of the town, that on the
preceding afternoon a party of the rebel tribe of Hooled
Bensoliman, from the neighbouring hills, had attacked a small
caravan belonging to Mesurata, and after killing four of the
people, had carried off the camels and baggage:—and they were also
informed, that on that very morning two men, who were going from
Mesurata to the market, which is held at some distance from the
town, were robbed and killed by the same party. At this news a
Council was summoned to determine on the prudence of attempting to
proceed; for the Shereefs began to distrust the sufficiency of that
title to an exemption from the violence of war, on which, when the
danger was distant, they had so confidently relied. The opinion of
Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> being asked, he observed, that as
the party which committed the depredations were described as not
more than forty or fifty<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_67">[67]</span> in number, and were consequently much too
weak to resist the detachment that, they must be sure, would be
sent from Mesurata to revenge the violences of which they had been
guilty, he had not the smallest doubt of their being already
returned to the refuge of their mountains; but that at any rate,
their own numbers, considering how well they were armed, were amply
sufficient to defend them from the attacks of such petty marauders.
Pleased with an opinion which gave them the prospect of but little
danger, they fresh primed their muskets and pistols, and singing as
they went, drove merrily on.</p>

<p>At six o’clock they encamped upon a hill directly opposite to
the enemy’s mountains, that were now within twelve or fifteen
miles; and having lighted, by Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>’s
advice, about seventy fires, for which the dry brush-wood that was
near them furnished the means, they had soon the satisfaction of
observing, that the fires of the enemy, who probably mistook them
for the troops of Mesurata, were all extinguished.</p>

<p>Feb. 7th. The next morning at day-break, in the midst of a storm
from the S.W. of violent rain and wind, they left the hill; and
after a tempestuous march of four hours, they discerned through the
heavy atmosphere, which now began to clear, a party of
fifty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> or sixty Arabs
upon a rising ground, at a distance, to the left.—That more were
concealed behind the hill, they had not the smallest doubt; but as
escape was impossible, and consultation useless, they resolved
unanimously to <em>make</em> rather than <em>receive</em> the
attack. The Shereef Fouwad took the command, and having given the
charge of the camels to the three Negros and their wives, with
orders to drive them slowly, and keep them close together, led on
the rest of the party. The horse, with the Shereef at their head,
formed the van, while those on foot were mixed together in a croud,
dancing, and shouting, and twirling their muskets over their heads,
and running round each other like madmen, till they came within
shot of their antagonists, when they suddenly dispersed, and each
man squatted down behind a bush, to shelter himself and take a
surer aim. The horse were now close upon the enemy, and were
levelling their pieces at the foremost, when one of the latter laid
down his musket, and called to them not to fire, for they were
friends.</p>

<p>A moment’s pause was followed by a mutual recollection, and they
exhibited, on both sides, the most extravagant marks of joy. They
ran round each other like a flock of frighted sheep, and danced,
and shouted, and twirled their guns over their heads, till they
were tired, when they sat down and began a reciprocal<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> congratulation on their safety.
The strangers said that they were herdsmen belonging to Mesurata;
that for want of pasturage near the town, they had brought their
flocks to feed upon these hills; that they were 200 armed men, and
that they did not fear the enemy.</p>

<p>After this information, and the exchange of civilities, the
caravan continued its journey, and at six in the evening arrived at
Mesurata.</p>

<p>The Governor, whose politeness and natural good sense had been
improved by a long residence in Italy, received Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span> with marks of the greatest attention; but
expressed his fear that, while the war continued, the Shereefs
would not be able to obtain from the Rebel Arabs, who alone could
furnish them, the 120 camels which were requisite for the
conveyance of their goods: and that, as the prospect of peace was
at present remote, and the sultry season would soon commence, he
saw but little chance of their reaching Fezzan before the following
Winter.</p>

<p>Feb. 9th. Information was now received at Mesurata, that the
Bey’s army, which consisted of 1,500 horse and 6,000 foot, was
encamped within five hours march of the Rebels, whose
force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> was composed of
600 horse and 10,000 foot, and was commanded by a powerful Chief of
the name of Séife Bennazar.</p>

<p>It was also said, that the Tribes of the friendly Arabs, who
formed the principal part of the Tripoline army, were too closely
connected, by intermarriages and the force of antient alliance,
with many of the Rebel Clans, to bring with them to the battle that
sort of zeal which Government could safely trust.</p>

<p>Feb. 10th. Such was the situation of affairs when the Shereef
Fouwad requested from the Governor, to whom he was strongly
recommended by the Minister, a public and formal declaration, that
if the hostile Arabs would send to Mesurata 120 camels, with their
drivers, for the conveyance of the merchandize of the Shereefs to
Fezzan, both they and their cattle should be perfectly secure. The
Governor replied, that by his own authority alone he could not,
with either prudence or effect, announce to the Rebel Arabs such a
stipulation; but that he would summon a Council of the Chiefs of
the town, and would propose the business to them; though he himself
was persuaded, that should they consent to the Shereef’s
requisition, as he hoped they would, the Rebel Arabs were much too
cautious to rely on the good faith of such an engagement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Feb. 11th. The
next morning, a Council of six of the principal inhabitants, with
the Governor as President, assembled in Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span>’s tent, (for the Governor’s own house was near
the sea, at the distance of six miles from Mesurata) and
unanimously agreed that a letter should be written by the Governor,
and signed by himself and by all the Members of the Council, to
assure the hostile Arabs, that such of their camels and of their
people, as they might send at the request of the Shereef, should
neither be detained or molested within the jurisdiction of
Mesurata. This letter, accompanied by one from the Shereef, in
which he desired to be furnished with 120 camels for the carriage
of his goods, was accordingly sent on that very day, by an express,
to a rebel province, in which he had many friends, and which is
called Gouady.</p>

<p>Feb. 14th. In three days from the time of his departure, the
express returned, and brought with him a reply, in which the Arabs
observed that, as the country was in arms, they could not with
prudence trust their camels from under their own protection, much
less could they spare their people.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this answer, the Shereef Fouwad conceived that
the refusal of the Arabs was solely dictated by a distrust
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span> the sort of
security which was offered by the Governor and Council of Mesurata;
for independently of the doubts which the Arabs might entertain of
their good faith, it was evident, that without the sanction of the
Bey, who commanded the army, their engagement, at the utmost, could
not extend beyond their own jurisdiction. But if the Bey himself
would guaranty the safety of the camels and their drivers, by
granting them a pass, the Shereef concluded that the real
objections of the Arabs would be entirely removed. With this view,
on the 27th of February, the Shereef and two of his countrymen set
out for the camp, which they reached on the second day, as it was
not far from Mesurata; but their trouble was fruitless, for the Bey
could not be prevailed on to assent to their proposal.</p>

<p>All hopes of obtaining, before the conclusion of the war, a
sufficient conveyance for the goods being thus at an end, the
Council resolved that, until peace should be established, the
Shereefs and the other Merchants of the caravan should be at
liberty to warehouse their packages in the public store-rooms of
the Governor.</p>

<p>Deprived, in this manner, of all prospect of arriving this year
at Fezzan, and doubtful if the state of the country would
encourage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> or his own
situation permit the attempt in the Winter, Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span> resolved to avail himself to the utmost of such
means of information as the knowledge of his fellow-travellers
enabled them to afford.</p>

<p>He had already discovered that the little old Shereef Imhammed
had been often employed by the King of Fezzan as his Factor in the
Slave Trade; and in that capacity had travelled to Bornou and
different parts of Nigritia; and he now determined to cultivate his
friendship with double solicitude, and by occasional presents and
frequent conversation, to draw from him an account of the countries
which he had seen. With this view he, one evening, took from his
pocket his map of Africa, and after satisfying the Shereef’s
curiosity as to its nature and use, told him that he once intended
it as a present to the King of Fezzan; but, that having discovered
in it several mistakes, he now proposed to draw another that should
be more correct. The Shereef replied, that the King would be highly
gratified with such a present. Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>
said, that if he would assist him with an account of the distances
from place to place, in such parts of the country as he had
visited, and with their names in Arabic, and would also satisfy him
as to such questions as he should ask, he would prepare
<em>two</em> corrected copies of the map,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_74">[74]</span> and would give one of them to the King and
the other to himself. The Shereef was delighted with the proposal;
and they immediately retired to a sand hill at some distance from
the tent, that their conversation might be unreserved and
uninterrupted. Many successive days were employed in the same
manner; and as Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> wrote down, at the
time, the information which he obtained, he was soon possessed of
such an account of Fezzan, Bornou, and Nigritia, especially of the
two former, as much diminished the chagrin of his own
disappointment.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as they sat together on the customary hill, they
were suddenly disturbed by the loud screams and dismal howlings of
all the women of Mesurata—a mode of alarming and collecting the
men, which is always practised among the Arabs, on the approach of
thieves, or of an invading enemy.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the townsmen were under arms, and together with
the Shereef Fouwad, the other Fezzaners, and Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span>’s Black, went hastily on to the place where the
Rebels were said to have appeared:—there they found that the women
had been deceived. It seems an ass had strayed into a field of
barley; and as the owner of the corn, who was armed, and happened
to pass by at the time, went into the field to drive out the
animal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> the women
mistook him for one of the Rebels, and conceiving that many more
were concealed, (for they often come down from the mountains to
steal the cattle) had given the usual alarm.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> and the old
Shereef, who had both continued on the hill, observed the Fezzaners
coming sulkily back, and cursing the women for so foolish a
disturbance, whilst the townsmen, on the contrary, fired their
pieces, and rejoiced in their disappointment as much as if they had
conquered an army.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, a second alarm was given, and with much
more reason than the first; for a party of the Rebel Arabs, some on
horseback, and others on foot, had suddenly appeared within two
miles of the town, and after killing two herdsmen, and seizing
three Black slaves, their assistants, had carried off sixty goats,
fourteen cows, and three camels.</p>

<p>The attack was made at a time when most of the townsmen were at
the market, which is held at the distance of three miles from
Mesurata; and to add to their indignation, it was made in a place
which hitherto had been deemed inviolable; for the land<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> on which the cattle were feeding
was considered as under the immediate protection of a departed
Saint, whose remains were buried there, and whose sanctuary, it was
thought, no Musselman, however accustomed to robbery and blood,
could venture to profane.</p>

<p>March 13th. Letters by express from the camp were now received
by the Governor, which announced, that in consequence of the Bey’s
having entered the country of the Rebels, and turned his cattle to
pasture in their corn, an engagement, which soon became general,
had ensued; that after a loss of 150 men, the Rebels had retired to
the mountains; and that the Bey, at the expence in killed and
wounded, of not more than twenty-six horse and seventy or eighty
foot, had obtained possession of ten or twelve thousand sheep, and
of three hundred camels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> congratulated the Governor on
the victory, who thanked him; but “I fear,” said he, shaking his
head, “that the news requires confirmation. There <em>was</em> a
time, indeed, when the people of Tripoli knew how to conquer, and
the Arabs trembled at the sight of an encampment.”</p>

<p>March 15th. On the next day but one, accounts were
brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span> by different
persons who arrived from the camp, that there had indeed been a
skirmish, in their relation of which they varied much from each
other; but they all agreed that the Bey had lost a greater number
of men, and that the only cattle which he had obtained, were a few
camels and some sheep that the straggling parties from the camp had
seized.</p>

<p>Wearied with fruitless expectations of a peace, disappointed in
their expedients, and warned by the increasing heat, that the
season for a journey to Fezzan was already past, the Shereefs now
resolved to proceed to the intended places of their Summer
residence.</p>

<p>The Shereef Fouwad retired to Wadan, his native town; and the
Shereef Imhammed, with tears in his eyes, and an earnest prayer
that he might see his friend Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>
again in November, retired to the mountains, where he had many
acquaintance, and could live at a small expence.</p>

<p>March 20th. A few days afterwards, Mr. <span class=
"gs">Lucas</span> took leave of the Governor, to whose civilities
he had been much indebted, and having accompanied a small caravan
as far as Lebida, embarked in a coasting vessel at the neighbouring
village of Legatah, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_78">[78]</span> went by sea to Tripoli, where the Bashaw,
upon whom he waited, and to whom with many acknowledgments he
returned the mule, not only received him with great kindness, but
expressed his hope that better fortune would attend him another
year.</p>

<p>April 6th. From Tripoli he sailed for Malta, and after a tedious
quarantine, which the suspicion of the plague at Mesurata had much
prolonged, he took his departure for Marseilles, and on the 26th of
July arrived in England.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="xlarge">A</span><span class=
"allcaps">n</span> account has already been given of the
opportunity which the length of his residence in Mesurata afforded
to Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>, of obtaining from the Shereef
Imhammed a description of the Kingdom of Fezzan, and of such of the
countries beyond it to the South as the Shereef himself had
visited.</p>

<p>But though this intelligent stranger had no discoverable motive
for deception, yet as the solitary evidence of any individual
excites but a dubious belief, Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> was
anxious to learn from the Governor of Mesurata, who had formerly
travelled to Fezzan, his idea of the truth of the Narrative. With
this view he asked and received the Governor’s permission to read
to him the memorandums that the repeated conversations of Imhammed
had enabled him to make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“The Shereef’s
Account of Fezzan,” said the Governor, “my own knowledge confirms;
and many of the particulars which he relates of Bornou and Cashna I
have heard from the report of others. His countrymen say that he is
better acquainted with both than any other individual among them;
and such is the opinion which the King himself entertains of his
probity, knowledge, and talents, that to his management is always
entrusted whatever business in either of those empires his
Sovereign has to transact.”</p>

<p>But while Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>, with a prudent and
laudable caution, was thus endeavouring to ascertain the truth of
the Shereef’s account, another, and perhaps more decisive test of
its value was fortunately obtained in England.—For, before the
return of Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>, or the arrival of his
papers, the Committee of the Association, assisted by Mr.
<span class="gs">Dodsworth</span>, (whose residence of fourteen
years in Barbary had given him a competent knowledge of Arabic) had
procured from Ben Alli, a native of Morocco, at that time in
London, an account of all those countries to the South of the
Desart of Zahara, which, in the course of his extensive Travels as
a Merchant, he had formerly visited: and though his remarks appear
to be those of a superficial Observer, who possesses activity of
spirit rather than energy of mind, and whose
remembrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> of what
he saw is impaired by the lapse of near twenty years; yet, (as will
be seen in the following pages) the general conformity of his
description of Bornou to that which the Shereef has given, has an
obvious tendency to strengthen the credit of the latter.</p>

<p>This short account of the nature of the only external evidence
that has yet been obtained in support of the following Narrative
seemed to be due from the Committee; but in what degree that
evidence is impressive of belief, or what internal marks of
authenticity the Work itself may afford, the judgment of others
must decide; for on these points, it is evident that each
individual must determine for himself. In forming his opinion,
however, it is requisite he should know, that while the most
anxious attention has been given to the faithful preservation of
the sense of the Original, an entire change has been made in its
language and arrangement; a change which, the obvious advantage of
methodizing conversations, as desultory as they were numerous, of
separating the blended accounts of unconnected objects, and of
uniting a variety of broken and detached descriptions of the same
thing, has unavoidably occasioned.</p>

<hr class="decordb2 width25 space-below">

<p class="nind"><span class="xlarge">F</span><span class=
"allcaps">ezzan</span>, whose small and circular domain is placed
in the vast Wilderness, as an island in the midst of the ocean, is
situated to the South of Mesurata. A journey of eight days, through
districts but little inhabited or improved, though naturally not
unfertile, conducts the Traveller to the town of Wadan, where every
requisite for the refreshment of the caravan is found.—From thence,
in five hours, he arrives at the forlorn village of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> Houn, on the edge of the Desart
of Soudah, on whose black and obdurate soil, the basis of which is
a soft stone, no vegetable but the Talk is seen to grow. To this
tree, which is of the size of the small Olive, and bears a sprig of
yellow flowers, the husbandman of Fezzan is indebted for the hard
and lemon-coloured wood of which he forms the handles of his tools,
and the frames of his larger instruments. Having crossed the
Desart, which furnishes no water, and for the passage of which four
days are requisite, the Traveller accepts the refreshments of a
miserable village that affords him nothing but dates of the worst
quality, some brackish water, and a small supply of Indian corn, of
the species called Gassób. From Zéghen, by which name the village
is distinguished, a single day conducts him to the town of Sebbah,
where the large remains of an antient castle, built upon a hill,
and other venerable ruins, that in point of extent are compared to
those of Lebida, impress on his mind the melancholy idea of
departed greatness; while, on the other hand, the humble dwellings
of the modern inhabitants, and the rich vegetation of their
neighbouring fields, present to his eye an ample store of all that
is requisite for the sustenance of man.—Dates, barley, Indian corn,
pompions, cucumbers, fig trees, pomegranates, and apricots, and for
meaner purposes, the white thorn and Spanish broom are described as
but a part of the numerous vegetables that reward<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> the industry of the people. The
animals in which they most abound are said to be the common fowl,
and the brown long-haired and broad-tailed sheep.</p>

<p>From Sebbah a journey of two days transports the Traveller to
Goddoua, a small town of similar produce; and from thence, in two
days more, he arrives at Mourzouk, the capital of the kingdom of
Fezzan.</p>

<p>This city<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> is surrounded by a high wall, which not only
furnishes the means of defence, but affords to the Government an
opportunity of collecting, at its three gates, a tax on all goods
(though provisions are exempted) that are brought for the supply of
its people. Its distance from Mesurata, which borders
on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> the coast, and
with respect to which its situation is nearly South, is about<a id=
"FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> 390
miles.</p>

<p>Eastward of Mourzouk, and situated in a district of remarkable
fertility, is the town of Zuéela, in which the remnants of antient
buildings, the number and size of the cisterns, and the
construction of the vaulted caves, intended perhaps as repositories
for corn, exhibit such vestiges of antient splendour, as will
probably attract, and may highly reward the attention of the future
Traveller.</p>

<p>To the South of Zuéela, and nearly at the same distance from the
capital, is the town of Jermah, which, like Zuéela, is
distinguished by the numerous herds, especially of sheep and
goats,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> that are seen
around it; by the various and abundant produce of its adjacent
fields; and by numerous and majestic ruins, that exhibit to the
ignorant inhabitants of its clay-built cottages inscriptions of
which they know not the meaning, and vestiges of greatness to which
they are perfectly indifferent.</p>

<p>Tessouwa, a considerable town, is also situated to the Eastward
of the capital; but seems to have no claim to particular attention.
Near this town, a river which the Shereef describes as overwhelmed
in the moving sands, but which he remembers a deep and rapid
stream, had formerly its course.</p>

<p>More remote from Mourzouk, being distant from it in a N.E.
direction, about 120 miles, is the large town of Temmissa. Here the
caravan of Pilgrims from Bornou and Nigritia, which takes its
departure from Mourzouk, and travels by the way of Cairo to Mecca,
usually provides the stores of corn and dates, and dried meat, that
are requisite for its dreary passage.</p>

<p>S.E. from the capital, and distant from it about sixty miles, is
the small town of Kattrón, which seems to be remarkable for nothing
but the quantity which it breeds of the common fowl,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> for the abundant
crops of Indian corn which the neighbouring lands afford.</p>

<p>Very differently distinguished is the town, or rather the
province, of Mendrah, for though much of its land is a continued
level of hard and barren soil, the quantity of <em>Trona</em>, a
species of fossil alkali that floats on the surface, or settles on
the banks of its numerous smoaking lakes, has given it a higher
importance than that of the most fertile districts.</p>

<p>Of this valuable produce great quantities are annually brought
by the Merchants of Fezzan to Tripoli, from whence it is shipped
for Turkey and Tunis, and the dominions of the Emperor of Morocco.
The people of the latter employ it as an ingredient in the red dye
of the leather, for which they are famous, and in that of the
woollen caps that are worn by the Arabs and the Moors as the basis
of their turbans.</p>

<p>The situation of Mendrah is nearly South from the capital, and
is distant from it about sixty miles.</p>

<p>To the account which has been given of the principal towns of
Fezzan, that of Tegérhy alone remains to be added. It
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span> but a small town,
is situated S.W. of the capital, about eighty miles, and collects
from its lands but little other produce than dates and Indian corn.
The territory of Fezzan, to the Westward of the capital, appears to
extend but a little way; for on that side, the sullen barrenness of
the Desart, more effectually than the strongest human power,
prescribes a limit to the pursuits of Avarice and to the efforts of
Ambition.</p>

<p>Of the smaller towns of Fezzan, and of its scattered villages,
the number of which, including that of the towns, is said to be
little less than one hundred, the Shereef has given no particular
description.</p>

<p>The towns themselves appear to be chiefly inhabited by
husbandmen and shepherds; for, though they also contain the
Merchants, the Artificers, the Ministers of Religion, and the
Officers of the Executive Government; yet, the business of
agriculture and pasturage seems to be the principal occupation of
the natives of Fezzan.</p>

<p>In every town a market for butcher’s meat, and corn, and fruit,
and garden vegetables, is regularly held. Mutton and goats flesh
are sold by the quarter, without being weighed; the
usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span> price of a
quarter of a goat or sheep is from thirty-two to forty grains of
gold dust, or from four to five shillings of English money. The
flesh of the camel, which is much more highly valued, is commonly
sold at a dearer rate, and is divided into smaller lots.</p>

<p>The houses, like those of the little villages in the
neighbourhood of Tripoli, are built of clay, and are covered with a
flat roof, that is composed of the boughs and branches of trees, on
which a quantity of earth is laid. Inartificial and defective as
this covering appears, it is suited to the climate: for as rain is
never known in Fezzan, the principal requisites of a roof are
shelter from the dews, and protection from the sun.</p>

<p>The heats of the Summer, which begins in April and continues
till November, are so intense, that, from nine in the morning till
sun-set, the streets are frequented only by the labouring people,
and even in the houses respiration would be difficult, if the
expedient of wetting the apartments did not furnish its salutary
aid. Of this torrid clime the fierceness is chiefly felt from the
month of May to the latter end of August; during which period, the
course of the wind is usually from the E. the S.E. the S. or the
S.W. and though from the two latter points it blows with
violence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span> the heat is
often such as to threaten instant suffocation; but if it happens to
change, as, for a few days, it sometimes does, to the W. or N.W. a
reviving freshness immediately succeeds.</p>

<p>The dress of the inhabitants of Fezzan is similar to that of the
Moors of Barbary. The immediate covering of the body consists of a
pair of large trowsers, of linen or cloth, which descends to the
small of the leg, and of a shirt, which is wide in the sleeves, but
close at the breast, and the skirts of which hang over and conceal
the upper part of the trowsers. Next to the shirt is worn a kind of
waistcoat, which in shape resembles the shirt, except that it has
no sleeves, and that it reaches no lower than the waist; and to the
waistcoat is superadded a jacket, with tight sleeves which extend
to the wrist, but which are left unbuttoned and open from the wrist
almost to the elbow. Thus far their dress may be said to be similar
to that of a British seaman, its colour excepted, and except too,
that the shirt is not open at the breast, that the waistcoat is not
fastened with buttons, but is put on like the shirt, and that the
bottom of the shirt hangs down on the outside of the trowsers.</p>

<p>Over the jacket is worn a loose robe, which reaches below the
knee, and the sleeves of which, though wider than those of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> jacket, are made
in the same form, and, like them, are left open at the wrist.</p>

<p>A girdle of crimson silk binds the robe to the waist; and a long
cloth (called a barakan or alhaique) of the shape of a Highlander’s
plaid, and worn in the same way, is thrown over the whole. The
legs, as far as the calves, to which the trowsers descend, are
covered with a kind of short stockings, which are made of leather,
and are laced like the half boot of an Englishman. The feet are
accommodated with slippers; and the head is protected by a red
woollen cap, which is incircled by the folds of a silk or muslin
turban.</p>

<p>Ample as this cloathing may appear, the further provision of a
long cloak with a large hood is often considered as requisite. It
is called a burnoose, and in fine weather is usually carried on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>Such, when complete, is the dress of the inhabitants of Fezzan.
But in the Summer months the common people have no other covering
than the drawers, which decency requires; and the caps, which
protect their heads from the immediate action of the sun, for in
other respects their bodies are compleatly naked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>Nature and custom
have formed their constitutions to such high degrees of heat, that
any approach to the common temperament of Europe entirely destroys
their comfort; for Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span> often
observed, in his journey to Mesurata, that when the scorching heat
of the noon-day beams had compelled him to seek the shade, his
fellow-travellers, especially if the wind was in the North, laid
themselves down, upon the sand in the open sun, in order to receive
a double portion of his warmth; and when, as their custom was, they
enquired after his health, they, almost always, concluded with the
expression, “<em>Heack m’andick berd</em>,” we hope you are not
cold.</p>

<p>The Diseases that are most frequent in Fezzan are those of the
inflammatory, and those of the putrid kind.</p>

<p>The small-pox is common among the inhabitants; violent head-achs
attack them in the Summer; and they are often afflicted with
rheumatic pains.</p>

<p>Their old women are their principal physicians. For pains in the
head they prescribe cupping and bleeding; for pains in the limbs
they send their patients to bathe in the hot lakes,
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span> produce the
trona; and for obstinate achs and strains, and long continued
stiffness in the muscles, they have recourse, like the
horse-doctors of Europe and the physicians of Barbary, to the
application of a burning iron.</p>

<p>The use of the strongest oils, and of the most powerful herbs,
is also frequent among them.</p>

<p>To the nature of their climate the greatest part of their
diseases is probably owing; and to this cause they are certainly
indebted for the extraordinary multitude of noxious and of
loathsome animals that infest their country. Adders, snakes,
scorpions, and toads, are the constant inhabitants of their fields,
their gardens, and their houses. The air is crowded with mosquitos;
and persons of every rank are over-run with all the different kinds
of vermin that attack the beggars of Europe; and though in the
Summer the fleas entirely disappear, the inhabitants are scarcely
sensible of relief.</p>

<p>In their persons, the natives of Fezzan incline to the Negro
much more than to the Arab cast. Those who travelled with Mr.
<span class="gs">Lucas</span> from Tripoli to Mesurata, and who
were fourteen in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
number, had short curly black hair, thick lips, flat broad noses,
and a dark<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> skin, which, either from their habitual
nastiness, the vermin with which they are covered, or the natural
rankness of their perspiration, emits the most nauseous and fetid
effluvia. They are tall, but not strong; well shaped, yet indolent,
inactive, and weak; and though the Shereef Fouwad is described as
majestic in his appearance, yet his countrymen, in general, are
considered at Tripoli as a people of remarkable ugliness.</p>

<p>In their common intercourse with each other all distinctions of
rank appear to be forgotten; for the Shereef and the lowest
plebeian, the rich and the poor, the master and the man, converse
familiarly, and eat and drink together. Generous and eminently
hospitable, the Fezzanner, let his fare be scanty or abundant, is
ever desirous that others should partake of his meal; and if twenty
people should unexpectedly visit his dwelling, they must all
participate as far as it will go.</p>

<p>When they settle their money transactions, they squat down upon
the ground, and having levelled a spot with their
hands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> make dots as
they reckon; and if they find themselves wrong, they smooth the
spot again, and repeat the calculation. All this time the
by-standers, though they have nothing to do with the business, are
as eager to put in their word, and to correct mistakes, as if the
affair was their own. Even in common conversation, if they sit
without doors, they level the sand in order to go on with their
discourse, and at every sentence mark it with their fingers.</p>

<p>An extensive plain, encompassed by mountains, the irregular
circle of which is interrupted on the West, where it seems to
communicate with the Desart, composes the Kingdom of Fezzan. To the
influence of the neighbouring heights it may possibly be owing,
that in Fezzan, as in the Upper Egypt, the situation of which is
extremely similar, no rain is ever known to fall.</p>

<p>A light sand constitutes the general soil; and sand hills of
various forms are seen in particular districts; but though the
character of the surface and the dryness of the Heavens may seem to
announce an eternal sterility, yet the springs are so abundant, and
so ample a store of subterraneous water is supplied by the adjacent
heights, that few regions in the North of Africa<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> exhibit a richer vegetation.
From wells of eight or ten feet deep, with several of which every
garden and every field are furnished, the husbandman waters, at
sun-rise, the natural or artificial productions of his land. Of
these the principal are,</p>

<p>The Talk, a tree that in size resembles the small Olive. It
flowers in yellow sprigs, and supplies the hard and lemon-coloured
wood, from which the handles and frames of the Fezzanner’s
instruments of husbandry are made:</p>

<p>The White Thorn:</p>

<p>A kind of brushwood that resembles the Spanish broom:</p>

<p>The Date tree, which is common:</p>

<p>The Olive and the Lime, which are described as scarce; the
Apricot, the Pomegranate, and the Fig:</p>

<p>Indian corn and barley, the two favourite objects of the
Fezzanner’s cultivation:</p>

<p>Wheat, of which but little is raised:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>Pompions or
calabash, carrots, cucumbers, onions, and garlick.</p>

<p>Of the <em>tame</em> animals that are raised in Fezzan, the
Shereef enumerates,</p>

<p>The Sheep, which is described as of a light brown colour; as
having a broad tail, and as cloathed with a species of hair rather
than of wool:</p>

<p>The Cow, which does not seem to be common, except in a few
districts in which the pasture is excellent:</p>

<p>The Goat, and the Camel:</p>

<p>A species of the domestic fowl of Europe.</p>

<p>The <em>wild</em> animals of the country are,</p>

<p>The Ostrich:</p>

<p>Antelopes of various kinds, one of which is called the Huaddee,
and is celebrated for the singular address with which, when chased
by the hunter amidst its craggy heights, it plunges
from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> the precipice,
and lighting on its hams without danger of pursuit, continues till
evening in the vale below:</p>

<p>A species of deer of a smaller size than the common park deer of
England. Its head, neck, and back, are of a brownish red; and a
pale streak of the same colour, running on a white ground, is
continued on each side from the haunch to the hoof: the rest of the
body is of a clear and delicate white. Such, if the Fezanners are
to be credited, is the cleanliness of its temper, or such, more
probably, is its dislike to the chill of a watery soil, that during
the autumnal rains, which fall in the Desarts of Zahara, where it
chiefly inhabits, no traces of its lying down have ever yet been
seen. In the stillness of the night it often ventures to the corn
fields of Fezzan, where, in traps prepared for the purpose, it is
sometimes taken.</p>

<p>The <em>food</em> of the lower classes of the people consists of
the flour of Indian corn, seasoned with oil; of dates, apricots,
and pomegranates, and of calabashes, cucumbers, and garden
roots.</p>

<p>Persons of a superior rank are also supplied with wheat bread,
which is baked in their own houses; with mutton, goats
flesh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> the flesh of
the camel, and that of the antelope; and with a great variety of
fruits, and of garden vegetables.</p>

<p>Fezzan produces a sufficiency of salt for the consumption of its
own inhabitants.</p>

<p>The water in general has a mineral taste; yet some of the
springs are pure; but the favourite beverage consists of a liquor
which the date tree, like the palm, affords. At first it possesses
the mild flavour and cooling quality of orgeat; but acquires, when
fermented, an acescent taste and intoxicating strength that are
still more highly valued.</p>

<p>To the palm the loss of so large a proportion of its sap is
generally fatal; but the hardier date tree recovers from its wound,
and in the course of two or three years regains its former
health.</p>

<p>In their <em>Religion</em> the people of Fezzan are rigid
Mahometans; not intolerant to the opinions of others, but strict
and superstitious in the observance of their own.</p>

<p>The <em>Government</em> of Fezzan is purely monarchical; but its
powers, which seem to be restricted by the influence of
opinion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> are
administered with such paternal regard to the happiness of the
people, the rights of property are so much revered, the taxes are
so moderate, and the course of justice is directed by so firm, and
yet so temperate a hand, that the inhabitants of Fezzan (as far as
a judgment can be formed from the feelings of those who travelled
with Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>) are affectionately and
ardently attached to their Sovereign.<a id=
"FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The present King, Mohammed Ben Mohammed, is descended from one
of the Shereefs of Tafilet, in the kingdom of Morrocco, who was
related to the Regal Family of that empire, and who, about 400
years since, obtained possession of the Crown of Fezzan.</p>

<p>From that period to the middle of the present century, the
kingdom maintained its Independence; but at the latter æra, the
Bashaw of Tripoli invaded it with a powerful force,
laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> siege to the
capital, defeated, and took captive the King, and carried him a
prisoner to Tripoli. For two years the unfortunate Monarch was
detained in bondage, but at the end of that period, on the
condition of an annual tribute of fifty slaves and ten pounds of
gold dust, the Bashaw restored him to his Crown.</p>

<p>Till the accession of the present King of Fezzan, this tribute
was faithfully transmitted; but the reigning Sovereign, conscious
of the declining power of Tripoli, and of the internal strength
which the affection and confidence of his people had given to his
Kingdom, has gradually diminished the amount, and altered the
nature of the acknowledgement; for it now consists in an occasional
present of a few slaves, and of a pound or two of gold dust, and is
rather the compliment of a trading State to the Kingdom in which
its principal commodities are sold, than a proof of political
dependence. Still, however, the expression of <em>my</em> Kingdom
of Fezzan is in frequent use with the reigning Bashaw of Tripoli,
who is the grandson of the Conqueror; nor has the dependence of the
former State on the latter been ever directly renounced.<a id=
"FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>In Fezzan, as in
all the Countries in which the Mahometan Faith is established, the
descendants of the Prophet are considered as a distinct and highly
privileged order. Their property is sacred; their persons are
inviolable; and while the colour of their turbans, and the revered
title of Shereef, announce to the people the august dignity which
they bear, they derive from the hereditary nature of their
privileges a high degree of permanent influence, and sometimes of
dangerous power.<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class=
"fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Among the privileges of their rank may be numbered an exemption
from certain punishments, and that sort of general indulgence which
the prevalent dread of shedding the blood of the Prophet
unavoidably creates.</p>

<p>To these circumstances of distinction it is owing that, like the
Nobility of other States, they are sometimes subjected to, and feel
a particular apprehension of the penalty of dishonour, especially
of that of having dust thrown upon their heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>But great as the
privileges of this high order unquestionably are, the individuals
who compose it have no union or general concert with each other;
for neither in contests for power, nor in resistance to oppression,
do they ever act as a body.</p>

<p>Some of the class are devoted to the indolence of a religious
life; but a larger proportion is engaged in the active concerns and
progressive pursuits of commerce: for, in general, the descendants
of Mahomet, following the example of their great ancestor, are
either Princes or Merchants.</p>

<p>The <em>Revenue</em> of Fezzan is composed of a variety of
branches, the principal of which are,</p>

<p>1st, A tax on towns and villages, at the rate of from 100 to 500
mitkals each. The number of towns and villages is estimated at 100;
and the value of a mitkal at about ten shillings English:
consequently, the tax on each town and village is from 50l. to
250l. sterling.</p>

<p>2d, A tax on every camel’s load of goods (provisions for the
market excepted) which enters the capital. The rate of this impost
is one mitkal, or ten shillings English, per load.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>3d, The fines
that are inflicted as a punishment for offences.</p>

<p>4th, The produce of such lands as on the death of the
possessors, without heirs, escheat to the Crown.</p>

<p>5th, A small tax on all gardens and date trees.</p>

<p>To these several branches of revenue may be added, as another
source of considerable income, the commerce in which the King is
engaged; for he seems, especially in the articles of trona and
senna, to be the principal Merchant in his kingdom.</p>

<p>Gold dust constitutes among the people of Fezzan the chief
medium of payment; and value in that medium is always expressed by
weight.</p>

<p>Their common measures of weight, and consequently of value,
are,</p>

<p>The xarobe (or harrobe) the weight of which is four grains, and
which expresses the value of thirty-three piastres of Tripoli, or
6d. sterling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>The mitkal, the
weight of which is eighty-one grains, and which expresses the value
of 668¼ Tripoli piastres, or 10s. 1½d.</p>

<p>A single grain therefore is equal in value to 1½d.</p>

<p>In the choice of the first of these measures, the xarobe, they
seem to have been influenced by the discovery, 1st, That four
grains is the usual weight of a hard and durable berry,<a id=
"FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
which is called habbat ell goreth; and 2dly, That half that weight,
two grains, is the weight of another and very beautiful berry,
which is brought from Nigritia, and to which, from its scarlet
colour, and the black stroke that ornaments one of its ends, they
have given the name of eyne-deeka, or the cock’s eye. These berries
are therefore employed as the common weights for gold dust in
Fezzan; for the xarobe and the mitkal have only an ideal
existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>But for the
greater convenience of exchange, the Merchants of Fezzan are
generally furnished with small papers of gold dust, of different
values, from that of two xarobes, or one shilling, to such an
amount as their business is likely to require.</p>

<p>If the value of the article to be purchased is less than two
xarobes, the payment is generally made in corn or flour. Thus the
smaller articles of provisions, as eggs, onions, &amp;c. are
generally purchased by a proportionable value in corn.</p>

<p>In this view of the currency of Fezzan, the small fractions that
would be requisite to render it perfectly accurate are omitted.</p>

<p>A mitkal is 675 piastres of Tripoli, or a fraction more than
10s. 1½d. sterling, and consequently it exceeds, by a fraction, the
amount of 20 xarobes.</p>

<p>The grains of Fezzan are of the same<a id=
"FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
weight as in England,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_109">[109]</span> but the okea, or ounce of Fezzan, is very
different, for it contains 640 grains; whereas the English ounce
contains but 480, which is a fourth less.</p>

<p>A Fezzan ounce of gold therefore, or 640 grains, at 1½d. per
grain, must be worth in Fezzan 4l.</p>

<p>And an English ounce of gold, or 480 grains, at 1½d. per grain,
must be worth in Fezzan 3l.</p>

<p>Among the circumstances for which the natives of Fezzan, who
travelled with Mr. <span class="gs">Lucas</span>, considered their
Sovereign as eminently distinguished, they often mentioned his just
and impartial, but severe and determined administration of justice;
and as a proof of the ascendancy which, in this respect, he has
acquired over the minds of his subjects, they described the
following custom:—If any man has injured another, and refuses to go
with him to the Judge, the complainant, drawing a circle round the
oppressor, solemnly charges him, in the King’s name, not to leave
the place till the Officers of Justice, in search of whom he is
going, shall arrive: and such (if they are to be credited) is, on
the one hand, his fear of the punishment which is inflicted on
those who disobey the injunction, and so great, on the
other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> is his dread
of the perpetual banishment which, if he seeks his safety by
withdrawing from the kingdom, must be his inevitable lot, that this
imaginary prison operates as a real confinement, and the offender
submissively waits the arrival of the Officers of the Judge.</p>

<p>Small offences are punished by the bastinado: but those of a
greater magnitude subject the convict, according to the different
degrees of guilt, to the penalty of a fine, of imprisonment, or of
death.—Shereefs, like the Nobility of other States, are sometimes
punished, as was mentioned before, by the pain of dishonour; in
which class of punishments, the most dreaded, because the most
reproachful, is the indignity of having dust heaped upon their
heads.</p>

<p>To their insulated and remote situation, and to their natural
barrier of desolate mountains and dreary wastes of sand, much more
than to military strength, the people of Fezzan are indebted for
their security.</p>

<p>Trusting to this natural defence, their towns are without
guards, and, their capital excepted, are also without walls; nor
have they any regular standing force: yet the Shereef
conceives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> that 15
or 20,000 troops might, upon an emergency, be raised. The only
expedition of a military nature that has happened within his
remembrance, was undertaken on the following account:—</p>

<p>South-East of the capital, at the distance of 150 miles, is a
wide and sandy desart, entirely barren, and oppressed with a
suffocating heat. Immediately beyond this desart, the width of
which is about 200 miles, the mountains of Tibesti, inhabited by a
wild and savage people of that name, begin to take their rise.
Ferocious in their manners, free-booters in their principles, and
secure, as they thought, in the natural defences of their
situation, these independent mountaineers became the terror of the
caravans which traded from Fezzan to Bornou, and which are obliged
to pass the Western extremity of the Desart. But at length, having
plundered a caravan which belonged to the King himself, and having
killed about twenty of his people, their conduct provoked his
resentment, and determined him to revenge the insult. With this
view he immediately raised a small army of from 3 to 4,000 men, the
command of which he gave to an able and active <em>Magistrate</em>,
announcing, by that appointment, that he sent them, not to subdue a
respectable enemy, but to punish an assemblage of plunderers and
assassins. Having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
compleated the difficult passage of the desart, and having gained
the first ascent of the mountains, they proceeded without
opposition, till at length the natives, who waited in ambush,
rushed upon them, and with the bows and arrows, and lances, with
which they were armed, began a furious assault: but the instant
that the foremost of the soldiers had given their fire, the
mountaineers, more alarmed at the dreadful sounds which they heard,
and at the imagined lightning which they saw, than terrified with
the slaughter that was made, threw down their arms, and flying with
great precipitation, abandoned, to the mercy of the victors, their
houses and their helpless inhabitants. The next morning, a
deputation, from the natives, of their principal people arrived at
the camp, with humble intreaties that their wives and children
might be spared, and an offer, on that condition, to submit to any
terms which the Alcaid should desire to impose. The Alcaid
accordingly demanded, and received, as hostages for their future
conduct, twenty of their principal people, with whom, and with all
the plunder which the country afforded, he returned in triumph to
Fezzan. There the King entertained them with kindness, and under a
promise that their nation should acknowledge him as their
<em>Sovereign</em>, and should annually pay to him a tribute of
twenty camel loads of senna, made them valuable presents; and with
strong impressions on<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_113">[113]</span> their minds, of the generous treatment
which they had received, sent them back to Tibesti.</p>

<p>From that period no attempt to molest his caravans has been made
by the mountaineers; and though they neither acknowledge the King
of Fezzan for their Sovereign, nor pay him any tribute, yet they
bring the whole of their senna to Mourzouk for sale, where it is
purchased to great advantage by the King, and is afterwards sold,
on his account, at the market of Tripoli.</p>

<p>An occasional visit to the Court of Fezzan is paid by their
Chief, who is always received with great hospitality, and after a
residence of a few weeks, is dismissed, with a present of a long
robe.</p>

<p>The vales of Tibesti are fertile in corn, and pasturage for
cattle, of which they have numerous herds, and are particularly
celebrated for their breed of camels, which are esteemed the best
in Africa. For this fertility they are indebted to the water of the
innumerable springs that amply compensate for the want of rain,
which seldom, if ever, falls within the limits of Tibesti.</p>

<p>Huts of the simplest construction (for they are formed of
stakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span> driven into
the ground in a circular arrangement, and covered with the branches
of trees and brushwood intermixed) compose the dwellings of the
people.</p>

<p>In return for the senna and the camels which they sell in
Fezzan, they bring back coral, alhaiks, or barakans, Imperial
dollars, and brass, from the two last of which articles they
manufacture the rings and bracelets which are worn by their
women.</p>

<p>Among the natives of Tibesti different religions are professed;
for some of them are Mahometans, and others continue attached to
their antient system of Idolatry.</p>

<p class="sch"><em>Mode of Travelling in Africa.</em>
</p>

<hr class="decordb2 width25 space-below">

<p class="nind"><span class="xlarge">T</span><span class=
"allcaps">he</span> mode of travelling in Africa is so connected
with the commerce, and therefore with the manners of its principal
nations, that without some knowledge of the <em>former</em>, a
description of the two <em>latter</em> cannot be clearly
understood.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The shereef Imhammed.</span>In that
division of Africa which lies to the North of the Niger, the season
for travelling begins with the month of October, and terminates
with the month of March. During this period, the temperature of the
air, though strongly affected by<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_116">[116]</span> the degree of latitude, the elevation of
the land, the distance of the sea, and the direction of the wind,
is comparatively cool; <span class="sidenote">Ben Alli.</span>and
in some places, as in the neighbourhood of Mount Atlas, and on the
Coasts of the Mediterranean, occasionally exhibits the phenomena of
an European Winter. At Tripoli, the Thermometer is sometimes seen
at the 40th degree of Farenheit’s scale, and on the 31st of
December, in the year 1788, was <span class=
"sidenote">Lucas.</span>observed, at nine in the morning, to have
fallen within four degrees of the freezing point; a coldness that
was followed by a light shower of snow.</p>

<p>In all countries, the animals which Nature and the attention of
man have provided for the conveyance of the Traveller, and for the
transit of his merchandize, are suited to the character of
<span class="sidenote">Imhammed and Ben Alli.</span>the soil, and
to the smoothness or inequality of its surface. Of the soil of
Africa, to the North of the Niger, the prevailing character is
sand; and though in the neighbourhood of rivers, and in all those
districts which receive from the adjacent mountains, the advantage
of numerous springs, the sand is blended with a vegetable mould,
yet the ground, in general, is remarkably soft and dry. In general,
too, the surface of the land, though in some places broken by naked
rocks, and swelling, in others, to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_117">[117]</span> mountains of considerable magnitude, may be
regarded as comparatively level.</p>

<p>To such a country the camel is peculiarly suited; for his broad
and tender foot, which slides on a wet surface, and is injured by
the resistance of stones, is observed to tread with perfect
security and ease on the dry and yielding sand: and while, from the
same circumstances in its structure, his hoof is incapable of
fastening, with any strength, on the ground of a steep ascent, and
furnishes, in a shelving declivity, no solid or sufficient support,
his movement on a smooth and level surface is singularly firm and
safe.</p>

<p>So remarkably exemplified in Africa is that rule in the œconomy
of Nature which suits the beast of burthen to the land <span class=
"sidenote">Imhammed.</span>which it inhabits, that in the country
which lies to the South-West of the Niger, where the surface is
mountainous, and the ground is as stony in some places, as it is
wet and muddy in others, no camels are found. Their place is
supplied by small horses, asses, and mules.</p>

<p>The proper burthen for a camel varies with its strength, which
is very different in different species of the animal. In the
dominions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> of
Tripoli, a common load is from three to four <span class=
"sidenote">Lucas.</span>hundred weight; and the medium expence of
the conveyance for each hundred appears to be one farthing per
mile.</p>

<p>The usual rate of travelling is three miles in the hour, and
<span class="sidenote">Lucas.</span>the number of hours that are
actually employed on the rout, exclusive of those which are
allotted to refreshment, is seldom more than seven or eight in a
day. Of the number of days which are consumed on a long journey,
many are devoted to the <span class=
"sidenote">Imhammed.</span>purpose of occasional trade, to that of
recruiting the strength of the camels, and to that of procuring
additional stores of provisions and of water; for in all such
places as are able to furnish a supply of provisions (which are
generally places of considerable population, and therefore of some
traffic) the stay of the caravan is seldom less than two days, and
is often prolonged to more.</p>

<p>The general food of the camels is such only as their nightly
<span class="sidenote">Ben Alli.</span>pasture affords; and is
often confined to the hard and thorny shrubs of the Desart, where a
sullen vegetation is created by the rains of the Winter, and upheld
by the dews that descend in copious abundance through all the
remainder of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Of the drivers
and servants of the caravan, the customary food <span class=
"sidenote">Imhammed.</span>consists of the milk of the camel, with
a few dates, together with the meal of barley or of Indian corn,
which is sometimes seasoned with oil, while the Merchant superadds,
for his own use, the dried flesh of the camel, or of sheep, and
concludes his repast with coffee.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Imhammed and Ben Alli.</span>Water is
drawn from the wells in leather buckets, that form a part of the
travelling equipage of the caravan, and is carried in the skins of
goats, through which, however, though tarred both within and
without, it is often exhaled by the heat of the noon-day sun.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ben Alli.</span>A particular mode of easy
conveyance is provided for the women and children, and for persons
oppressed with infirmity or illness: six or eight camels are yoked
together in a row, and a number of tent poles are placed in
parallel lines upon their backs: these are covered with carpets,
and bags of corn are superadded to bring the floor to a level, as
well as to soften the harshness of the camel’s movement; other
carpets are then spread, and the traveller sits or lies down, with
as much convenience as if he rested on a couch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>The Desart (a
term of the same meaning with its Arabic name of Zahara) may be
said, like the ocean, to connect the very nations which it seems to
separate; for, in comparison with the woods and morasses of
America, it furnishes the Merchant with an easy and convenient
road.</p>

<p>A sandy heath of various levels, in some places naked and
<span class="sidenote">Ben Alli.</span>bare, but much more
frequently covered with an odoriferous plant, which the Arabs call
the Shé, and which, though far superior in fragrance, has at least
a remote resemblance to the wild thyme of Europe, constitutes the
general appearance of the Desart. The exceptions, however, are
interesting and important: for besides the diversity that arises
from the different shrubs, which are often scantily intermixed with
the Shé, and of which the thorny plant that forms the harsh food of
the camel appears to be the most common, an essential variation is
furnished by the comparative fertility of some particular
districts, and by the total barrenness of others.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Imhammed and Ben Alli.</span>In some
portions of the general wilderness, thousands of sheep, and goats,
and cows, are seen to pasture; while in others nothing is presented
to the eye but desolate hills of shifting sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>To the last of
these the name of <em>Desarts without Water</em> is <span class=
"sidenote">Imhammed.</span>emphatically given; a name that conveys
to an Arab ear the fearful idea of an intense and suffocating heat,
of the total absence of vegetable life, and of the hazard of a
dreadful death. For though the movement of the shifting sands is
not so rapid as to endanger the safety of the caravan, yet as the
scorching heat of the sun-beams, confined and reflected by the
hills of sand, hourly diminishes the store of water, and as the
breadth of several of those desarts is that of a ten days journey,
the hazard of perishing with thirst is sometimes fatally
experienced.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Imhammed.</span>All means of ascertaining
the rout by land-marks, the usual guides in other parts of the
wilderness, are here destroyed by the varying forms and shifting
position of the hills; but from anxious observation and continued
practice, the camel-drivers acquire a sufficient knowledge of the
bearings of the sun and stars to direct them in their way.</p>

<p>Such are the expedients by which the difficulties of the Desart
are in general overcome: those which are presented by the broad
current of the impetuous Niger, though much more easily, are not so
frequently surmounted.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Imhammed.</span>Of this river, which in
Arabic is sometimes called Neel il<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_122">[122]</span> Kibeer, or the Great Nile, and at others,
Neel il Abeed, or the <span class="sidenote">Imhammed and Ben
Alli.</span>Nile of the Negros, the rise and termination are
unknown, but the course is from East to West. So great is the
rapidity with which it traverses the Empire of Cashna, that no
vessel can ascend its stream; and such is the want of skill, or
such the absence of <span class=
"sidenote">Imhammed.</span>commercial inducements among the
inhabitants of its borders, that even <em>with</em> the current,
neither vessels nor boats are seen to navigate. In one place,
indeed, the Traveller finds accommodations for the passage of
himself and of his goods; but even there, <span class=
"sidenote">Imhammed.</span>though the ferrymen, by the indulgence
of the Sultan of Cashna, are exempted from all taxes, the boat
which conveys the merchandize is nothing more than an
ill-constructed raft; for the planks are fastened to the timbers
with ropes, and the seams are closed both within and without, by a
plaister of tough clay, of which a large provision is always
carried on the raft for the purpose of excluding the stream
wherever its entrance is observed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Imhammed.</span>The depth of the river at
the place of passage, which is more than a hundred miles to the
South of the City of Cashna, the capital of the empire of that
name, is estimated at twenty-three or twenty-four feet
English.<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class=
"fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>Its width is
such that even at the Island of Gongoo, where the <span class=
"sidenote">Imhammed.</span>ferrymen reside, the sound of the
loudest voice from the <span class="sidenote">Ben
Alli.</span>northern shore is scarcely heard; and at Tombuctou,
where the name of Gnewa, or black, is given to the stream, the
width is described as being that of the Thames at Westminster. In
the rainy season it swells above its banks, and not only floods the
adjacent lands, but often sweeps before it the cattle and cottages
of the short-sighted or too confident inhabitants.</p>

<p>That the people who live in the neighbourhood of the Niger
should refuse to profit by its navigation, may justly surprise the
<span class="sidenote">Imhammed and Ben Alli.</span>Traveller; but
much greater is his astonishment, when he finds that even the food
which the bounty of the stream would give, is uselessly offered to
their acceptance; for such is the want of skill, or such the
settled dislike of the people to this sort of provision, that the
fish with which the river abounds are left in undisturbed
possession of its waters.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Imhammed.</span>Having passed the stream,
the face of the country, and with it the mode of travelling, are
changed. High mountains and narrow valleys, extensive woods and
miry roads, succeed to the vast plains and sandy soil of the Zahara
and its neighbouring kingdoms. Water is no longer refused or
scantily given to the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_124">[124]</span> parched lips of the Traveller; but while
the abundance of this refreshment, and of the vast variety both of
vegetable and animal <span class="sidenote">Imhammed.</span>food
that is offered in profusion for his support, diminish the
hardships and remove the principal hazards of his journey, the
raging heat of the Torrid Clime increases as he proceeds. Wet
cloths applied to the mouth are sometimes requisite, and especially
in the woods, to allay, for the purpose of respiration, the
violence of the burning air; and the journey, which the fierceness
of the sun suspends, is often renewed amidst the dews and
comparative darkness of the night.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Imhammed.</span>From the want of camels,
which are seldom seen to the South of Cashna, nor even to the West,
except in higher latitudes, the conveyance of the Merchant and his
goods is committed to the mules, and small horses and asses of the
country. Of the first, the usual burthen is 200lbs. of the second,
150lbs. and of the last, 100lbs.</p>

<p>Travelling through all this part of Africa is considered as so
secure, that the Shereef Imhammed, with the utmost chearfulness and
confidence of safety, proposed to accompany and conduct Mr.
<span class="gs">Lucas</span>, by the way of Fezzan and Cashna,
across the Niger, to Assenté, which borders on the Coast of the
Christians.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="xlarge">T</span><span class=
"allcaps">o</span> the South of the kingdom of Fezzan, in that vast
region which spreads itself from the river of the Antelopes
westward for 1200 miles, and includes a considerable part of the
Niger’s course, two great empires, those of Bornou and those of
Cashna, are established.</p>

<p>The circumstances of soil and climate, and those also which
constitute political character, are nearly the same in both: for
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> prevailing
winds are the same; their rains, which are periodical in each,
though much more profuse in Bornou, begin at the same season; the
same grains are cultivated; the same fruits (generally speaking)
are produced; and except that no camels are bred to the westward of
the City of Cashna, the capital of the empire, the same animals are
reared. In both, the complexion of the inhabitants is black; their
mode of building too is similar, and their manners, though in some
respects more civilized in Bornou, have a general resemblance.</p>

<p>Each of the two empires is formed by the subjection of different
tribes or nations to the dominion of one ruling people. The nature
of the Government, and the laws which regulate its succession, are
the same in both. In both, the ruling people are Mahometans; in
both, the dependent nations are composed of converts to the
Musselman faith, and of adherents to the antient worship; and
though at present their languages are different, the conquerors in
both had probably the same original.</p>

<p>Of these empires, Cashna, till of late, was esteemed the first
in power; but though a thousand villages and towns are
still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span> included in
her vast domains, she is now considered as much inferior to
Bornou.</p>

<h3><em>ROUT FROM MOURZOUK TO BORNOU.</em>
</h3>

<div class="figdecor2 iwdecor4"><img src='images/decor4.png' alt=
'[Decoration]'>
</div>

<p>FROM Mourzouk in Fezzan to Bornou, the capital of the empire
from which it takes its name, the Fezzanners, whose commercial
spirit no distance can discourage, are conducted by a rout of more
than a thousand miles. Temmissa, the first town at which they
arrive, and the last which they see in Fezzan, they reach on the
seventh day; and in three days more they enter the territories of
Bornou. Several villages, inhabited by Blacks, whose persons, their
waists excepted, are entirely naked, whose meagre limbs and
famished looks announce their extreme of misery, and whose
idolatrous religion neither excites the resentment nor restrains
the charity of the benevolent Fezzanners, mark the northern
frontier of the empire.</p>

<p>On the day following their departure from these melancholy
hamlets, they begin the ascent of a hilly uninhabited desart of
sand, where a few bushes of penurious vegetation point out
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> successive
wells that are found in these barren heights, and diminish the
fatigues of a three days passage. At the close of the fourth day
they enter a plain that is inhabited by Mahometans, where, in
addition to a plentiful supply of excellent water, they are cheared
with the sight of date trees, and of Indian corn.</p>

<p>From this plain, which lies to the West of the Desart of
Tibesti, and the end of which they reach on the second day, a part
of the Tibesti mountains take their rise. These vast hills, the
range of which is very extensive, are variously peopled; but such
of them as are crossed on the rout from Fezzan to the City of
Bornou, are inhabited by a mixture of Musselmen and Idolaters, who
employ themselves in breeding camels and asses, and other cattle,
particularly horses of a small size.</p>

<p>Exclusively of the two days that are requisite for the passage
of the mountains, an allowance of twice that time is generally
given to refreshment and repose; soon after which a fertile and
beautiful country, as richly diversified as numerously peopled,
opens to their view. Its inhabitants are herdsmen, and with the
exception of a few Pagans who are intermixed among them, are
Musselmen in their faith. Their dwellings are in tents<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> which are composed of hides,
and their wealth consists in the multitude of their cows and
sheep.</p>

<p>Four days are employed in crossing these fortunate districts:
the sixth conducts the caravan to the entrance of the vast and
burning Desart of Bilma. Surrounded by this dreary solitude, the
Traveller sees with a dejected eye the dead bodies of the birds
that the violence of the wind has brought from happier regions; and
as he ruminates on the fearful length of his remaining passage,
listens with horror to the voice of the driving blast, the only
sound that interrupts the awful repose of the Desart.</p>

<p>On the eleventh day from their entrance on these scorching
sands, the caravan arrives in the fertile plains that encompass the
Town of Domboo, the approach to which is enlivened by the frequent
appearance of the majestic Ostrich, and of the gay but fearful
Antelope.</p>

<p>From thence, in about five days, they reach the City of Kánem,
the capital of an extensive and fertile province, of which it bears
the name, and in which the inhabitants, who are composed of
Musselmen and Pagans, breed multitudes of cattle, and raise
innumerable horses for the service of the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>A journey of ten
days more concludes their labour, and brings them to the imperial
City of Bornou.<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13"
class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span><em>Bornou</em>,
the name which the natives give to the country, is distinguished in
Arabic by the appellation of Bernou or Bernoa, a word that
signifies the land of Noah, for the Arabs conceive that, on the
first retiring of the deluge, its mountains received the Ark.</p>

<p>The <em>Climate</em>, as may naturally be expected in a kingdom
which seems to be bounded by the 16th and the 26th
parallels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> of
latitude, is characterized by excessive, though not by uniform
heat. Two seasons, the one commencing soon after the middle of
April, the other at the same period of October, may be said to
divide the year. The <em>first</em> is introduced by violent winds
that bring with them, from the South East and South, an intense
heat, with a deluge of sultry rain, and such tempests of thunder
and lightning as destroy multitudes of the cattle, and many of the
people. During the rainy period (the continuance of which is from
three to nine successive days, with short intervals from the
occasional changes of the wind to the North or West) the
inhabitants confine themselves closely to their dwellings; but the
rest of the first season, however sultry and however occasionally
wet, is not incompatible with the necessary labours of the
husbandman and the shepherd.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the <em>second</em> season in the latter
part of October, the ardent heat subsides; the air becomes soft and
mild; the weather continues perfectly serene; and as the year
declines, an unwelcome coolness precedes the rising of the sun.</p>

<p>The inhabitants, though consisting of such a multitude of
nations that thirty languages are said to be spoken in the
empire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> are alike
in their <em>Complexion</em>, which is entirely black, but are not
of the Negro cast.</p>

<p>In a climate so warm, the chief recommendations of
<em>Dress</em> are decency and ornament: among the poorest,
therefore, by whom the first only is regarded, a kind of girdle for
the waist is sometimes the only covering; but in general a turban,
consisting, as in Barbary, of a red woollen cap, surrounded by
folds of cotton, together with a loose robe of coloured cotton of a
coarser kind, are also worn.<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Grain</em> that constitutes the principal object of
culture in Bornou is Indian corn, of two different kinds, which are
distinguished in the country by the names of the gassób, and the
gamphúly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>The gassób,
which in its general shape resembles the common reed, is of two
species; the first grows with a long stalk that bears an ear, which
in length is from eight to twelve inches, and contains, in little
husks or cavities, from three to five hundred grains, of the size
of small pease. The second species, which is common in Tripoli,
differs no otherwise from the first than in the shorter size of the
ear.</p>

<p>The gamphúly is distinguished from the gassób, by the bulk of
the stalk, for that of the gamphúly is much thicker, by the number
of its ears, for it has several on the same reed, and by the size
of the grain, which is considerably larger. This kind of corn is
frequently seen in Spain, and is there called Maize.</p>

<p>Wheat and barley are not raised in Bornou; but the horse-bean of
Europe and the common kidney-bean are cultivated with great
assiduity, as they are used for food, both by the slaves and by the
cattle.<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class=
"fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>In the culture
of these different grains, the hoe alone is employed, as the use of
the plough is still unknown to the people. The women divide with
the men the labours of their husbandry; for while the latter, with
their hoes, open the ground, and form the trenches in straight
lines parallel to each other, the women follow and throw in the
seed: nor is this the only part which they take in the business of
the field; for to them, as soon as the weeds begin to rise on the
ridges of the lines in which the grain is sowed, the hoe is
constantly transferred.</p>

<p>The sowing season commences at the end of the periodical rains
of April; and such in that climate is the rapid vegetation, that on
the 9th of July the gassób is reaped; but the gamphúly, a grain of
slower growth, is seldom cut till the month of August or
September.</p>

<p>Such are the several species of corn that, among the people of
Bornou, supply the place of the wheat, the barley, and the oats of
Europe. Two species of roots are also used as wholesome and
substantial food: the one, which is called the Dondoo, produces a
low plant, with branches that spread four or five feet upon the
ground, and leaves that resemble those of the garden-bean. At the
end of five months, from the time of its being<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_136">[136]</span> planted, the leaves fall off, and the
root is taken from the ground, and being cut into small pieces, is
dried in the sun, in which state it may be kept for two years. Its
further preparation consists in reducing it to a fine powder, and
mixing it with palm oil till it assumes the consistency of
paste.</p>

<p>The other root is that of a tree, of which the name had escaped
the Shereef’s recollection: boiling is the only process that is
requisite in preparing it for use.</p>

<p>The same character of sufficiency which marks the catalogue of
the different kinds of grain in Bornou, belongs also to the list of
its various <em>Fruits</em>; for though neither olives nor oranges
are seen in the empire, and even figs are rare, and though the
apples and plumbs of its growth deserve no commendation, and the
dates are as indifferent as they are scarce, yet grapes, and
apricots, and pomegranates, together with lemons and limes, and the
two species of melons, the water and the musk, are produced in
large abundance.<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16"
class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But one of the most valuable<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> of its vegetable stores, is a
tree which is called Kedéynah, that in form and height resembles
the olive, is like the lemon in its leaf, and bears a nut, of which
the kernel and the shell are both in great estimation, the first as
a fruit, the last on account of the oil which it furnishes when
bruised, and which supplies the lamps of the people of Bornou with
a substitute for the oil of olives.</p>

<p>To this competent provision of such vegetables as are requisite
to the support, or grateful to the appetite of man, must be added a
much more ample and more varied supply, of <em>Animal Food</em>.
Innumerable flocks of sheep, and herds of goats and cows, (for
there are no oxen) together with multitudes of horses, buffaloes,
and camels, (the flesh of which is in high estimation) cover the
vales or pasture on the mountains of Bornou.<a id=
"FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class=
"fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The common, though not the Guinea fowl is also reared by the
inhabitants; and their hives of bees are so extremely
numerous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> that the
wax is often thrown away as an article of no value in the
market.</p>

<p>Their <em>game</em> consists of the Huaddee, and other species
of antelopes, of the partridge, the wild duck, and the ostrich, the
flesh of which they prize above every other.</p>

<p>Their other wild animals are the lion, the leopard, the civet
cat, the small wolf, the fox, the wild dog, that hunts the
antelope; the elephant, which is not common, and of which they make
no use; the crocodile, the hippopotamus, which is often killed on
the banks of the river that runs from the Neel Shem, (the Nile of
Egypt) to the Desart of Bilma; and a large and singular animal,
which is distinguished by the name of Zarapah, and which is
described as resembling the camel in its head and body, as having a
long and slender neck like the ostrich, as being much taller at the
shoulders than the haunches, and as defended by so tough a skin, as
to furnish the natives with shields that no arrow or javelin can
pierce.<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>Bornou, like
other countries that approach the Equinoctial, is much infested
with different kinds of dangerous or disgusting reptiles,
especially snakes and scorpions, centipedes and toads.</p>

<p>Of its <em>beasts of burthen</em> the variety is as ample as the
numbers are abundant; for the camel, the horse, the ass, and the
mule, are common in the empire.</p>

<p>The dog, with which the inhabitants pursue their game, appears
to be their only <em>domestic</em> animal.</p>

<p>In the mountains of Tibesti, and perhaps in other parts of the
empire, the herdsmen, probably for the sake of a more easy change
of pasture, prefer a residence in tents to stationary dwellings;
and those, it seems, are not manufactured, like the tents of the
Zahara, from the camel’s hair; but are composed of the hides of
cows, a more durable and impervious covering.</p>

<p>Through all the empire of Bornou the same mode of
<em>building</em>, and with the difference of a greater or a
smaller scale, the same form in the plan of the houses universally
prevails.—Four walls, inclosing a square, are erected; within those
walls, and parallel to them, four other walls are also built: the
ground between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> the
walls is then divided into different apartments, and is covered
with a roof. Thus the space within the interior walls determines
the size of the court; the space between the walls determines the
width of the apartments; and the height of the walls determines the
height of the rooms. In a large house the rooms are each about
twenty feet in length, eleven feet in height, and as many in
width.</p>

<p>On the outside of the house, a second square or large yard,
surrounded by a wall, is usually provided for the inclosure and
protection of the cattle.<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Such is the general plan of a Bornou house. For the construction
of the walls the following method is constantly pursued: a trench
for the foundation being made, is filled with dry and solid
materials rammed in with force, and levelled; on these a layer of
tempered mud or clay is placed; and in this substitute for mortar a
suitable number of stones are regularly fixed. Thus with alternate
layers of clay and stones the wall proceeds; but<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> as soon as it has reached the
height of six or seven feet, the workmen suspend its progress for a
week, that it may have time to settle, and become compact; for
which purpose they water it every day.</p>

<p>When the walls are finished they are neatly plaistered, both
within and without, with clay or mud, tempered with sand; for the
country furnishes no lime.</p>

<p>The roofs are formed of branches of the palm tree, intermixed
with brushwood; and are so constructed as at first to be
waterproof; but such is the violence of the wind and rain, that the
end of the second year is the utmost period of their brief
duration.<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class=
"fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Much less attention is given to the furniture than is bestowed
on the structure of the houses; for the catalogue of the utensils
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> extremely short.
Among the lower classes of the inhabitants it consists of the mats
covered with a sheep-skin, upon which they sleep; of an earthen
pot; of a pan of the same materials; of two or three wooden dishes,
a couple of wooden bowls, an old carpet, a lamp for oil, and
perhaps a copper kettle.</p>

<p>Persons of a superior rank are also possessed of leathern
cushions, that are stuffed with wool; of several brass and copper
utensils, of a handsome carpet, and of a sort of candlesticks; for
instead of the vegetable oil which is used by the common people,
they employ the light of candles manufactured from their bees wax
and the tallow of their sheep.</p>

<p>Bornou is situated at the distance of a day’s journey from a
river which is called Wed-el-Gazel, from the multitude of antelopes
that feed upon its banks, and which is lost in the deep and sandy
wastes of the vast Desart of Bilma.<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>From the symmetry of the houses, and the general resemblance
which they bear to each other, a regular arrangement of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> streets might, with the utmost
ease, have been given to their towns. In Bornou, however, a
different system has prevailed; for even in the capital, the
houses, straggling wide of each other, are placed without method or
rule; and the obvious propriety of giving to the principal mosque,
a central situation, exhibits the only proof of attention to
general convenience.<a id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22"
class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The King’s palace, surrounded by high walls, and forming a kind
of citadel, is built, perhaps with a view to security, in a corner
of the town.<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class=
"fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Markets for the sale of provisions are opened within the city;
but for other articles, a weekly market, as in Barbary, is held
without the walls.</p>

<p>In general, the towns have no other defence than that which the
courage of the inhabitants affords: but the capital is surrounded
by a wall of fourteen feet in height, the foundations of which are
from eight to ten feet deep, and which seems to be built with
considerable strength. To this defence is given the additional
security of a ditch, which encompasses the whole; and care is
taken, that at sun-set the seven gates which form the communication
with the country shall be shut.<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The great population of Bornou is described by the indefinite
and metaphorical expression of a countless multitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>In Fezzan the
price of all things is measured by grains of gold; and where the
value is too small to be easily paid in so costly a metal, the
inhabitants have recourse to corn, as a common medium of exchange.
But in Bornou, as in Europe, the aid of inferior metals is
employed, and copper and brass (which seem to be melted together,
and to be mixed with other materials) are formed into pieces of
different weights, from an ounce to a pound, and constitute the
current species of the empire.<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Dominions so extensive as those of Bornou have seldom the
advantage of one uniform language; but an instance of so many
different tongues, within the limits of one empire, as are spoken
in that kingdom, and its dependencies, has still less frequently
occurred, for they are said to be more than thirty in number.</p>

<p>Of the language, however, which is current in the
capital,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> and which
seems to be considered as the proper language<a id=

<p>Two different <em>Religions</em> divide the sentiments, without
disturbing the peace of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The ruling people profess the Mahometan faith;<a id=
"FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
and though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span> the
antient Paganism of the dependent nations does not appear to
subject them to any inconvenience, a considerable part are converts
to the doctrines of the Prophet.</p>

<p>An elective monarchy constitutes the <em>Government</em> of
Bornou,<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class=
"fnanchor">[28]</a> and like the similar system of Cashna,
endangers the happiness, while it acknowledges the power of the
people. On the death of the Sovereign, the privilege of chusing
among his sons, without regard to priority of birth, a successor to
his throne, is conferred by the nation on three of the most
distinguished men, whose age and character for wisdom, are denoted
by their title of Elders; and whose conduct in the State has
invested them with the public esteem. Bound by no other rule as to
their judgment or restraint, as to their will, than that which the
expressed or implied instruction of electing the most worthy may
form, they retire to the appointed place of their secret
deliberation, the avenues to which are carefully guarded by the
people: and while the contending suggestions of private interest,
or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span> sense of the
real difficulty of chusing where judgment may easily err, and error
may be fatal to the State, keeps them in suspence, the Princes are
closely confined in separate chambers of the Palace. Their choice
being made, they proceed to the apartment of the Sovereign elect,
and conduct him, in silence, to the gloomy place in which the
unburied corpse of his father, that cannot be interred till this
awful ceremony is passed, awaits his arrival. There, the Elders
point out to him the several virtues and the several defects which
marked the character of his departed parent; and they also forcibly
describe, with just panegyric, or severe condemnation, the several
measures which raised or depressed the glory of his reign. “You see
before you the end of your <em>mortal</em> career; the
<em>eternal</em>, which succeeds to it, will be miserable or happy
in proportion as your reign shall have proved a curse or a blessing
to your people.”</p>

<p>From this dread scene of terrible instruction, the new
Sovereign, amidst the loud acclamations of the people, is conducted
back to the Palace, and is there invested by the electors with all
the slaves, and with two-thirds of all the lands and cattle of his
father; the remaining third being always detained as a provision
for the other children of the deceased Monarch. No sooner is the
Sovereign invested with the ensigns of Royalty, than<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> such of his brothers as have
reached the age of manhood prostrate themselves at his feet, and in
rising press his hands to their lips—the two ceremonies that
constitute the declaration of allegiance.</p>

<p>If any doubt of their sincerity suggests itself to the King or
to the Elders, death or perpetual imprisonment removes the fear;
but if no suspicion arises, an establishment of lands and cattle
from the possessions of their father, together with presents of
slaves from the reigning monarch, are liberally bestowed upon
them.</p>

<p>Often, however, the most popular, or the most ambitious of the
rejected Princes, covering his designs with close dissimulation,
and the zeal of seeming attachment, creates a powerful party; and
assured of Foreign aid, prepares, in secret, the means of
successful revolt. But, stained with such kindred blood, the
sceptre of the victorious Rebel is not lastingly secure—one
revolution invites and facilitates another; and till the slaughter
of the field, the sword of the executioner, or the knife of the
assassin has left him without a brother, the throne of the
Sovereign is seldom firmly established.</p>

<p>Such, in the Mahometan empires of Bornou and of
Cashna,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span> is the rule
of succession to the monarchy; but the Pagan kingdoms adjoining,
with obviously less wisdom, permit the several sons of the late
Sovereign, attended by their respective partizans, to offer
themselves, in person, to the choice of the electors, and be
actually present at the decision; an imprudence that often brings
with it the interference of other States, and unites the different
calamities of foreign and intestine war.</p>

<p>Those of the Royal Children of Bornou who are too young to take
their share in the reserved part of their deceased father’s
possessions, are educated in the Palace till the age of maturity
arrives; at which time their respective portions of lands and
cattle are assigned them.</p>

<p>To the four lawful wives of the late Sovereign, a separate
house, with a suitable establishment, is granted by the reigning
Monarch; and such of his numerous concubines as were not slaves,
are at liberty to return to their several friends; and, together
with leave to retain their cloaths, and all their ornaments, which
are often valuable, have free permission to marry.</p>

<p>In the empire of Bornou, as in all the Mahometan States, the
administration of the provinces is committed to
Governors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
appointed by the Crown; and the expences of the Sovereign are
partly defrayed by his hereditary lands, and partly by taxes levied
on the people.</p>

<p>The present Sultan, whose name is Alli, is a man of an
unostentatious plain appearance; for he seldom wears any other
dress than the common blue shirt of cotton or of silk, and the silk
or muslin turban, which form the usual dress of the country. Such,
however, is the magnificence of his seraglio, that the ladies who
inhabit it are said to be five hundred in number; and he himself is
described as the reputed father of three hundred and fifty
children, of whom three hundred are males; a disproportion which
naturally suggests the idea that the mother, preferring to the
gratification of natural affection, the joy of seeing herself the
supposed parent of a future candidate for the empire, sometimes
exchanges her female child for the male offspring of a
stranger.</p>

<p>Equally splendid in his stables, he is said to have 500 horses
for his own use, and for that of the numerous servants of his
household.</p>

<p>In many of the neighbouring kingdoms, the Monarch
himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span> is the
executioner of those criminals on whom his own voice has pronounced
the sentence of death; but the Sultan of Bornou, too polished, or
too humane, to pollute his hands with the blood of his subjects,
commits the care of the execution to the Cadi, who directs his
slaves to strike off the head of the prisoner.</p>

<p>The <em>Military</em> Force of the Sultan of Bornou consists in
the multitude of his horsemen; for his foot soldiers are few in
number, and are scarcely considered as contributing to the strength
of the battle.<a id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class=
"fnanchor">[29]</a> The sabre, the lance, the pike, and the bow,
constitute their weapons of offence; and a shield of hides composes
their defensive armour. Fire-arms, though not entirely unknown to
them, for those with which the Merchants of Fezzan occasionally
travel, are sufficient to give them an idea of their importance and
decisive effect, are neither used nor possessed by the people of
Bornou.</p>

<p>When the Sovereign prepares for war, and levies an army
for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> the purpose, he
is said to have a custom, (the result of idle vanity or of politic
ostentation) of directing a date tree to be placed as a threshold
to one of the gates of his capital, and of commanding his horsemen
to enter the town one by one, that the parting of the tree in the
middle, when worn through by the trampling of the horses, may
enable him to judge of the sufficiency of their numbers, and
operate as a signal that his levy is compleat.</p>

<p>In their <em>Manners</em>, the people of Bornou are singularly
courteous and humane. They will not pass a stranger on the road
till they have stopped to salute him: the most violent of their
quarrels are only contests of words; and though a part of the
business of their husbandry is assigned to the women, yet, as their
employment is confined to that of dropping the seed in the furrows,
and of removing the weeds with a hoe, it has more of the amusement
of occasional occupation, than of the harshness of continued
labour.</p>

<p>Passionately attached to the tumultuous gratifications of play,
yet unacquainted with any game but drafts, they often sit down on
the ground, and forming holes to answer the purpose of squares,
supply the place of men with dates, or the meaner
substitute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span> of
stones, or of camel’s dung. On their skill in the management of
these rude instruments of the game, they stake their gold dust,
their brass money, and even their very cloaths; and as the
bye-standers on these occasions constantly obtrude their advice,
and sometimes make the moves for the person whose success they
wish, their play is usually accompanied by that conflict of abuse,
and vehemence of scolding, which mark and terminate the sharpest of
their quarrels.</p>

<p>Such is the amusement of the lower classes of the people; those
of a superior rank are devoted to the more difficult and more
interesting game of chess, in which they are eminently skilled.</p>

<p>In countries that afford without cultivation, or that give in
return for slight exertions of labour, the principal requisites of
life, few articles of export are likely to be found. Those of the
Bornou Empire consist of—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>By what means
the gold dust, that appears to be a principal article of trade, is
procured by the inhabitants, whether from mines in the country, or
by purchase from other nations, the Shereef has not explained. But
of their mode of obtaining the Slaves, which constitute another
extensive branch of their commerce, he gives the following
account:</p>

<p>South East of Bornou, at the distance of about twenty days
travelling, and separated from it by several small desarts, is
situated an extensive kingdom of the name of Begarmee, the
inhabitants of which are rigid Mahometans, and though perfectly
black in their complexions, are not of the Negro cast. Beyond this
kingdom to the East are several tribes of Negros, idolaters in
their religion, savage in their manners, and accustomed, it is
said, to feed on human flesh. They are called the Kardee, the
Serrowah, the Showva, the Battah, and the Mulgui. These nations the
Begarmeese, who fight on horseback, and are great warriors,
annually invade; and when they have taken as many prisoners as the
opportunity affords, or their purpose may require, they drive the
captives, like cattle, to Begarmee. It is said that if any of them,
weakened by age, or exhausted by fatigue, happen to linger in their
pace, one of the horsemen seizes<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_156">[156]</span> on the oldest, and cutting off his arm,
uses it as a club to drive on the rest.</p>

<p>From Begarmee they are sent to Bornou,<a id=
"FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
where they are sold at a low price; and from thence many of them
are conveyed to Fezzan, where they generally embrace the Musselman
faith, and are afterwards exported by the way of Tripoli to
different parts of the Levant.</p>

<p>Such is the mode of obtaining the greatest part of the slaves
who are annually sold in Bornou; but as several of the provinces of
the empire are inhabited by Negros, their insurrections, real or
pretended, afford to the Sovereign an opportunity of increasing his
income by their sale.</p>

<p>A more politic and more effectual mode of aiding his finances is
fruitlessly offered by the salt lakes of the Province of Domboo:
for, as the great Empire of Cashna is entirely
destitute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span> of salt,
and none is found in the dominions of the Negros, the sole
possession of this article might insure to the King of Bornou a
constant and ample revenue of the best kind, a revenue collected
from the subjects of Foreign States; but such is the prevalence of
antient custom over the obvious suggestions of policy, that the
people of Agadez, a Province of the Cashna Empire, are annually
permitted to load their immense caravans with the salt of Bornou,
and to engross the profits of this invaluable trade. The salt is
collected on the shores of the several lakes which produce it, and
the only acknowledgement that the Merchants of Agadez give in
return for the article, is the trifling price which they pay in
brass and copper (the currency of Bornou) to the neighbouring
peasants.</p>

<p>The civet, which forms another article of the export trade of
Bornou, and the greatest part of which is sent to the Negro States
who inhabit far to the South, is obtained from a species of wild
cat that is common in the woods of Bornou and of Cashna.</p>

<p>This animal is taken alive in a trap prepared for the purpose,
is placed in a cage, and is strongly irritated till a copious
perspiration is produced. Its sweat, and especially the
moisture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> that
appears upon the tail, is then scraped off, is preserved in a
bladder, and constitutes the much valued perfume. After a short
interval the operation is renewed, and is repeated, from time to
time, till at the end of twelve or fourteen days the animal dies of
the fatigue and continual torment. The quantity obtained from one
cat is generally about half an ounce.</p>

<p>Of <em>Manufactures</em>, none for exportation are furnished by
the people of Bornou; but the Shereef remarks that, for their own
consumption, they fabricate from the iron ore of their country,
though with little skill, such slight tools as their husbandry
requires.<a id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class=

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>In return for
their exports, they receive the following goods:</p>

<p>Copper and Brass, which are brought to them from Tripoli, by the
way of Fezzan, and which, as already mentioned, are used as the
current species of Bornou;</p>

<p>Imperial Dollars, which are also brought to them from Tripoli by

</p>

<hr class="decordb2 width25 space-below">

<p class="nind"><span class="xlarge">E</span><span class=
"allcaps">qually</span> connected by their commerce with Cashna and
Bornou, the Fezzanners dispatch to the former as well as to the
latter, and always at the same season, an annual caravan. From
Mourzouk, their capital, which they leave at the close of October,
they take their course to the South South West, and proceed to the
Province of Hiatts, the most barren, and the worst inhabited
district of their country.</p>

<p>Five of the fourteen days which are requisite for this part of
their rout, are consumed in the passage of a sandy desart, in which
their usual expedient of covering their goat skins,
both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> within and
without, with a resinous substance, prevents but imperfectly the
dreaded evaporation of their water.</p>

<p>From the Province of Hiatts they cross the low mountains of
Eyré, which separate the Kingdom of Fezzan from the vast Empire of
Cashna; and leaving to their right the small river which flows from
these hills, and is lost in the deep sands of a neighbouring
desart, they enter a wide heath, uninhabited, but not destitute of
water. The sixth day conducts them from this extended solitude to
the long desired refreshments of the Town of Ganatt, where the two
next days are devoted to repose.</p>

<p>From thence, by a march of nineteen days, during six of which
they are immersed in the heats of a thirsty desart, they pass on to
the Town of Assouda, which offers them equal refreshments with
Ganatt, and equally suspends their journey.</p>

<p>On leaving Assouda, they traverse a delightful country, as
fertile as it is numerously peopled; and while the exhilarating
sight of Indian corn and of frequent herds of cattle accompanies
and chears their passage, the eighth day introduces them to the
large and populous City of Agadez, the capital of an extensive
province.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>Distinguished as
the most commercial of all the towns of Cashna, and, like Assouda
and Ganatt, inhabited by Mahometans alone, Agadez naturally
attracts the peculiar attention of the Merchants of Fezzan. Many of
them proceed no further; but the greatest part, committing to their
Agents the care of the slaves, cotton, and senna, which they
purchase in the course of a ten days residence, continue their
journey to the South.</p>

<p>In this manner, if the camels are compleatly loaded, seven and
forty days, exclusive of those which are allotted to refreshment
and necessary rest, are employed in travelling from Mourzouk to
Agadez.</p>

<p>At the end of three days more, amidst fields that are enriched
with the luxuriant growth of Indian corn, and pastures that are
covered with multitudes of cows, and with flocks of sheep and
goats, the Traveller reaches the small Town of Begzam; from which,
through a country of herdsmen, whose dwellings are in tents of
hides, the second day conducts him to the Town of Tegomáh. There,
as he surveys the stoney, uninhabited, desolate hills that form the
chearless prospect before him, he casts a regretful eye on those
verdant scenes that surrounded him the day before. Employed for two
days in the passage of these dreary heights, he descends on the
third to a deep and scorching sand,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_164">[164]</span> from which he emerges at the approach of
the fifth evening, and entering a beautiful country, as pleasingly
diversified with the natural beauties of hills and vales and woods,
as with the rich rewards of the husbandman’s and the shepherd’s
toil, he arrives in seven days more at the City of Cashna, the
capital of the empire of which it bears the name, and the usual
residence of its powerful Sultan.</p>

<p>The country to which the Geographers of Europe have given the
name of Nigritia, is called by the Arabs Soudán, and by the natives
Aafnou, two words of similar import, that, like the European
appellation, express the land of the Blacks, and like that too, are
applied to a part only of the region to which their meaning so
obviously belongs.—Yet, even in this limited sense, the word Soudán
is often variously employed; for while some of the Africans
restrict it to the Empire of Cashna, which is situated to the North
of the Niger, others extend it, with indefinite comprehension, to
the Negro States on the South of the river, and applying it as a
means of expressing the extended rule and transcendant power of the
Emperor of Cashna, call him, with extravagant compliment, the
Sultan of all Soudán.</p>

<p>His real sovereignty is bounded, on the North, by the mountains
of Eyré, and by one of those districts of the great
Zahara,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span> that
furnish no means of useful property or available dominion; on the
South, by the Niger; and on the East, by the Kingdom of Zamphara
and the Empire of Bornou. Its western limit is not described by the
Shereef; nor is any thing said of the Capital, except that it is
situated to the North of the Niger, at the distance of five days
journey, and that its buildings resemble those of Bornou.</p>

<p>The observations which introduced the account of Bornou, have
already announced the remarkable similarity, as well with respect
to climate, soil, and natural productions, as with regard to the
colour, genius, religion, and political institutions of the people,
that prevails between that powerful State and its sister Kingdom of
Cashna.</p>

<p>The <em>rains</em>, indeed, are less violent than those of
Bornou. It exclusively furnishes the Bishnah, a species of Indian
corn that differs from the gamphúly, in the blended colours of red
and white which distinguish its grain. Its monkeys and parrots
(animals but seldom seen in Bornou) are numerous, and of various
species. The meridian of its capital is considered as a western
limit, in that parallel of latitude, to the vegetation of grapes
and the breed of camels; for between Cashna and the Atlantic few
camels are bred, and no grapes will grow. The manners of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span> common people
are less courteous in Cashna than in Bornou, and their games are
less expressive of reflection; for their favourite play consists in
tossing up four small sticks, and counting those that cross each
other, as so many points of the number that constitutes the game.
But the circumstances of chief discrimination between the empires
are, those of language, currency, and certain articles of
commerce.</p>

<p>Of the difference between the <em>Languages</em> of Bornou and
of Cashna, the following specimen is given by the Shereef.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>The
<em>Currency</em> of Cashna, like that of the Negro States to the
South of the Niger, is composed of those small shells that are
known to Europeans and to the Blacks themselves by the name of
Cowries, and to the Arabs by the appellation of Hueddah.—Cardie,
which is another term for this species of Negro money, and the
specific meaning of which the Shereef has neglected to explain, is
said to be given to it by the idolatrous tribes alone; a
circumstance that seems to indicate superstitious attachment.—Of
these shells, 2,500 are estimated in Cashna as equal in value to a
mitkal of Fezzan, which is worth about 675 piastres of Tripoli, or
ten shillings and three half-pence sterling.</p>

<p>Among the few circumstances which characterize the
<em>Trade</em> of Cashna, as distinguished from that of Bornou, the
most remarkable is, that the Merchants of the <em>former</em>
kingdom are the sole carriers, to other nations, of a scarce and
most valuable commodity, which is only to be obtained from the
inhabitants of the <em>latter</em>. For though the salt of Bornou
supplies the consumption of Cashna, and of the Negro Kingdoms to
the South, yet its owners have abandoned to the commercial activity
of the Merchants of Agadez, the whole of that profitable trade.</p>

<p>The lakes, on the dreary shores of which this scarce
article<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> of African
luxury is found, are separated from Agadez by a march of five and
forty days, and are encompassed on all sides by the sands of the
vast Desart of Bilma, where the ardent heat of a flaming sky is
returned with double fierceness by the surface of the burning soil.
A thousand camels, bred and maintained for the purpose, are said to
compose the caravan which annually explores, in the savage
wilderness, the long line of this adventurous journey. Perilous,
however, and full of hardships as their labour is, the Merchants
find an ample recompence in the profits of their commerce; for
while the wretched villagers who inhabit the neighbourhood of the
lakes, and collect the salt that congeals upon the shores, are
contented to receive, or obliged to accept a scanty price, the
value that the Merchants obtain in the various markets of Cashna,
of Tombuctou, and of the countries to the South of the Niger, is
suited to the high estimation in which the article is held.</p>

<p>Attentive in this manner to the means of profiting by the
produce of a neighbouring country, the people of Agadez are equally
anxious to avail themselves of the commodities that are furnished
by their own; for knowing the superior quality of the senna which
grows upon their mountains, they demand and receive from the
Merchants of Fezzan a proportionable price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>The senna of
Agadez is valued in Tripoli at fourteen or fifteen mahaboobs, or
from 4l. 4s. to 4l. 10s. per hundred weight, while that of Tibesti
is worth no more than from nine to ten mahaboobs, or from 2l. 14s.
to 3l. sterling. From Tripoli the senna is exported to Turkey,
Leghorn, and Marseilles.</p>

<p>Of the other articles of sale which the extensive Empire of
Cashna affords, the principal are—</p>

<p>Gold Dust—the value of which appears to be estimated at a higher
rate in Cashna than in Fezzan; for in the former the worth of an
ounce of 640 grains (which is the weight of an ounce in Fezzan,
Cashna, and probably in all the States between that kingdom and the
Niger) is said to be nine mitkals, or 4l. 10s. sterling; whereas an
ounce of the same weight is worth in Fezzan but 4l. In Cashna the
value of an English ounce of 480 grains is consequently 3l. 7s. 6d.
whereas in Fezzan it is only 3l.</p>

<p>Slaves—In what manner these are obtained, does not distinctly
appear; but the value of a male slave is said to be from 15 to
20,000 cowries, or from 3l. to 4l. sterling:</p>

<p>That of a female slave is described as being two-thirds of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> former, or from
10,000 to 13,334 cowries, which in English money would be from 2l.
to 2l. 13s. 4d.</p>

<p>Cotton Cloths—which are the general manufacture of Cashna, of
Bornou, and of the Negro States to the South of the Niger:</p>

<p>Goat-skins—of the red and of the yellow dyes:</p>

<p>Ox and Buffalo Hides:</p>

<p>Civet—the mode of obtaining which, as well as the principal
markets for its sale, were described in the account which has been
given of the trade of Bornou.</p>

<p>In return for these articles the inhabitants of Cashna
receive—</p>

<p>Cowries—a sea shell which is brought from the coast, and
constitutes the common specie of the empire:</p>

<p>Horses and Mares—which are purchased from the Merchants of
Fezzan; but whether bred in that country, or procured from the
Arabs, or from the people of Bornou, is not mentioned by the
Shereef:</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="xlarge">T</span><span class=
"allcaps">he</span> account which the Shereef has given of such of
the kingdoms to the South of the Niger as he himself has visited,
is too deficient in geographical information to furnish a clear and
determinate idea of this part of his travels: and though the names
of the principal States in whose capitals he traded, or through
whose dominions he passed, may be used with advantage as the means
of future enquiry, and are therefore inserted in the map which
accompanies this Narrative; yet the places assigned them must be
considered as in some degree conjectural. That the line of his
journey was towards the Gold Coast, there is, however,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> the strongest reason to
believe; and the following brief account of his remarks may lead to
conclusions which are neither uninteresting nor unimportant.</p>

<p>From that part of the Niger which forms the southern limit of
the great Empire of Cashna, to the Kingdom of Tonouwah, which
borders on the coast of the Christians, and of which the Town of
Assenté is said to be the capital, a succession of hills, among
which are mountains of a stupendous height, diversifies or
constitutes the general face of the country. Most of the lands are
described as already cleared, but some particular districts are
still incumbered with woods of a vast extent; and though for the
most part the highlands are pastured by innumerable stocks of
sheep, and by herds of cows and goats, and the vales exhibit the
captivating view of successive villages, encompassed with corn and
rice, and fruits of various kinds, yet there <em>are</em> places of
native sterility and eternal barrenness.</p>

<p>The combined occupations of the shepherd and of the husbandman
compose the general employment of the people; while the cotton
cloth, and the goat-skins of the red and of the yellow dyes, that
are offered in several of the towns for sale, announce<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> the rudiments of future
manufactures, and perhaps of an extensive commerce.</p>

<p>Exempted by the nature of their climate from many of those
hardships from which, in other countries, dress is the principal
protection, a large proportion of the inhabitants wear only the
covering that decency requires. But most of the Mahometans, as the
mark of a religion which they are proud to profess, adorn their
heads with the folds of the turban, and also adopt, at least in
some of the States, the cotton shirt, which is so much worn in the
empires of Cashna and Bornou.</p>

<p>Tents, which are formed of the hides of cows or of buffaloes,
and which are peculiarly suited to the shepherd life, are the only
dwellings of multitudes of the Negros; while the huts, which others
erect with the branches of trees, are of a construction almost
equally simple.</p>

<p>Several of the towns are described as surrounded by walls; and
bows and arrows are mentioned as the common instruments of war.</p>

<p>In the description of their Governments, a few instances
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span> small Republics
are given; but most of their States are monarchical; and of these,
the inhabitants of the Mahometan Kingdom of Degombah are
distinguished by the custom of taming the Elephant, and by that of
selling for slaves the prisoners they take from such of the
bordering nations as motives of religion or of avarice prompt them
to invade.</p>

<p>Such, however, is the mildness of the Negro character, that even
the asperities of religious disagreement appear to have no effect
on their general conduct; for there is reason to believe, from the
Shereef’s account, that the Musselman and the Pagan are
indiscriminately mixed, that their cattle feed upon the same
mountain, and that the approach of evening sends them in peace to
the same village: and though the nations who are attacked by the
people of Degombah punish with death, as guilty of atrocious
injustice, such of the invaders as the chance of war throws into
their hands, yet those of the Mahometans who visit them for the
purposes of trade, are received with protection and respect.</p>

<p>To the Merchants of Fezzan, who travel to the southern States of
the Negros, the purchase of gold, which the dominions of several,
and especially of those of Degombah, abundantly<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> afford, is always the first
object of commercial acquisition. The other articles which they
obtain, consist of</p>

<ul class="simple no-space-above">
<li>Slaves,</li>

<li>Cotton Cloth,</li>

<li>Goat-Skins, of a beautiful dye,</li>

<li>Hides of Buffaloes and Cows, and</li>

<li>A species of Nut—which is much valued in the kingdoms to the
North of the Niger, and which is called Gooroo. It grows on a large
and broad leafed tree that bears a pod of about eighteen inches in
length, in which are inclosed a number of nuts that varies from
seven to nine. Their colour is a yellowish green; their size is
that of a chesnut, which they also resemble in being covered by a
husk of a similar thickness; and their taste, which is described as
a pleasant bitter, is so grateful to those who are accustomed to
its use, and so important as a corrective to the unpalatable or
unwholesome waters of Fezzan, and of the other kingdoms that border
on the vast Zahara, as to be deemed of importance to the happiness
of life.</li>
</ul>

<p>No commercial value appears to be annexed to the fleeces which
the numerous flocks of the Negro kingdoms afford; for the cotton
manufacture, which, the Shereef says, is established among the
tribes to the South of the Niger, seems to be the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> only species of weaving that
is known among them. Perhaps the dark colour of the fleece, as
disqualifying it for the dye, may be one reason, and its coarse and
hairy nature may be another, of the little esteem in which it
appears to be held.</p>

<p>In <em>return</em> for the articles which they sell to their
foreign visitors, the Negros receive—</p>

<ul class="simple no-space-above">
<li>Salt, from the Merchants of Agadez,</li>

<li>Dutch Knives,</li>

<li>Sabre Blades,</li>

<li>Carpets,</li>

<li>Coral,</li>

<li>Beads,</li>

<li>Looking-Glasses,</li>

<li>Civet,</li>

<li>Imperial Dollars and Brass—from both of which the Negro artists
manufacture rings and bracelets for their women.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fire Arms are unknown to such of the nations on the South of the
Niger as the Shereef has visited; and the reason which he assigns
for it is, that the Kings in the neighbourhood of the coast,
persuaded that if these powerful instruments of war should
reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> the
possession of the populous inland States, their own independence
would be lost, have strictly prohibited, and by the wisdom of their
measures, have effectually prevented this dangerous merchandize
from passing beyond the limit of their dominions.</p>

</p>

<hr class="decordb2 width25 space-below">

<p class="nind"><span class="xlarge">I</span><span class=
"allcaps">n</span> the general description of Fezzan, an account
was given of the various articles of native produce which supply
the wants, or contribute to the trade of its people; but of their
<em>Foreign</em> Commerce, for which, like the Dutch in Europe,
they are eminently distinguished, the detail was purposely
deferred: for till a previous account of the countries to which
that commerce is established had been exhibited, no adequate
conception of its nature or extent could be easily conveyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>At the latter
end of October, when the ardent heat of the Summer months is
succeeded by the pleasant mildness and settled serenity of Autumn,
the several caravans that are respectively destined for Tripoli and
Bornou and Cashna, and the Negro Nations beyond the Niger, take
their departure from Mourzouk, the capital of Fezzan. The parties
which compose them are generally small; for unless information has
been received that the road is infested with robbers, ten or a
dozen Merchants, attended by twice as many camels, and by the
necessary servants, constitute the usual strength of the caravan;
but if an attack is apprehended, an association of forty or fifty
men, with muskets for their defence, is formed; and as none of the
Africans to the South of Fezzan (the people of Agadez and the
nations on the coast excepted) have yet possessed themselves of
fire-arms, the collective force of such a number is sufficient to
insure their safety.</p>

<p>Their store of provisions usually consists of dates; of meal
prepared from barley, or from Indian corn, and previously deprived
of all its moisture in an oven temperately heated; and of mutton,
which is cured for the purpose, by the treble process of being
salted and dried in the sun, and afterwards boiled in
oil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span> or fat; a
process which gives it, even in that climate, a lasting
preservation.</p>

<p>In all the principal towns to which they trade, the Merchants of
Fezzan have Factors, or confidential Friends, to whose care, till
their return, or till their instructions as to the market shall
arrive, they consign such Negros as they purchase, perfectly
assured that the slaves will be forwarded by the Agents according
to the orders they receive; but their gold dust, as being more
easily conveyed, and less dependent for its value on the choice of
the market, is seldom entrusted to the Factor.</p>

<p>The caravans which proceed to <em>Tripoli</em> are freighted
partly with trona, the produce of their native land, and partly
with senna and gold dust and slaves, the produce of the southern
countries with which they trade; and in return they bring back the
cutlery and woollens (particularly red woollen caps) and silks,

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>Brass and
Copper—for the currency of Bornou. The caravan which Mr.
<span class="gs">Lucas</span> accompanied from Tripoli to Mesurata,
had brought ten camel loads or forty hundred weight of these metals
for the Bornou market: their value in Bornou is about four
shillings sterling for each pound weight.</p>

<p>Imperial Dollars—which are called in Arabic Real Abotacia, and
the value of which, in comparison with the dollars of Spain, is, at
Tripoli, as 365 piastres to 340, or nearly as 16 to 15:</p>

<p>Of the native produce of Fezzan the only article which is
brought as merchandize to Bornou is a preparation of pounded dates,
and of the meal of Indian corn, highly dried in an oven. It is
called Tickera, and is valued, especially by Travellers, as a
portable and highly salubrious food.</p>

corn, which is manufactured in Fezzan:</li>
</ul>

<p>Gooroo Nuts—which are brought from the Negro Countries on the
South of the Niger.</p>

<p>The articles received in <em>return</em>, are—</p>

<p>Gold Dust:—of which an English ounce (or 480 grains) appears to
be valued at 3l. 8s. 3d. though in Fezzan it seems to be worth no
more than 3l. The Fezzanners, in all probability, make themselves
amends by the price which they charge upon their goods.</p>

<p>Slaves—a male slave is worth in Cashna, from 3l. 10s. to 5l.—a
female slave is worth two-thirds of the amount, or from 2l. 6s. 8d.
to 3l. 6s. 8d.</p>

<p>Cotton Cloths—of various colours, principally blue and white, of
which in the Empire of Cashna, and in the Negro States to the South
of the Niger, great quantities are made:</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>Goat Skins—dyed
red or yellow,</li>

<li>Ox and Buffalo Hides—for tents,</li>

<p>Senna from Agadez—a province of the Cashna Empire; the Agadez
senna is worth at Tripoli, from fourteen to fifteen mahaboobs (4l.
4s. to 4l. 10s. sterling) per hundred weight; that which the
Fezzanners obtain at Tibesti is only worth per hundred weight, from
nine to ten mahaboobs, or from 2l. 14s. to 3l. sterling.</p>

<li>Ivory, though very common in the country to the South of the
Niger, is not considered by the Merchants of Fezzan, as an article
of profitable transport, the demand for it on the Coast being such
as induces them to sell to the Negros who traffic there, the teeth
which in the course of their journey, they often find in the

little communication with any of the States that are situated to
the West of the Empire of Cashna; a circumstance which the Shereef

the country on the West of Cashna furnishes but few camels, and

intercourse with the Mediterranean, and therefore with the States
of Europe, on the one hand, and on the other with the extensive
Empires of Bornou and Cashna, the dominions of Tombuctou, and the
various nations of Negros to the South of the Niger, the Merchants
of Fezzan are happily possessed of the farther advantage of
communicating by a safe and comparatively commodious<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> passage with the Cities of
Grand Cairo and of Mecca. A pilgrimage to the latter, the object,
from time immemorial, of veneration in Arabia, is prescribed to
every Musselman; and though the greatest part of the believers in
Mahomet, deterred by distance, or restrained by the avocations of
business and the feelings of domestic attachment, content
themselves with imperfect resolutions of performing at some future
period this arduous journey, yet there are persons, even from the
innermost recesses of Africa, who think, that a positive injunction
of their faith is too solemn for excuses, and too momentous for
delay. Prompted by this urgent consideration, or allured by the
honourable distinction which attends upon the title of Hadgee, the
envied appellation of those who have visited the sacred Temple, a
number of the faithful from the Empires of Bornou and Cashna, from
the extensive kingdom of Caffaba, and from several of the Negro
States, resort to Fezzan, and proceed from thence, with the
caravan, which in the Autumn of every second or third year takes
its departure for Mecca. The caravan, which seldom consists of less
than one hundred, or of more than three hundred Travellers,
assembles at Mourzouk, and begins its journey in the last week of
October, or in the first of the succeeding month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>Temissa, a town
in the dominions of Fezzan, and situated to the East North East of
Mourzouk, receives them at the close of the seventh day; and in two
days more, of easy travelling, they arrive at a lofty mountain,
rocky, uninhabited, and barren, of the name of Xanibba. Having
recruited their goat-skin bags from the only well which these
sullen heights afford, they descend to a vast and dreary desart,
whose hilly surface, for four successive days, presents nothing to
the eye but one continued extent of black and naked rock; to which,
for three days more, the equally barren view of a soft and sandy
stone succeeds. Through all this wide expanse of varied nakedness
no trace of animal or vegetable life, not even the desart thorn, is
seen. On the eighth day, the vast mountain of Ziltan, the rugged
sides of which are marked with scanty spots of brushwood, and are
enriched with stores of water, increases the labour of the journey.
Four days are devoted to the toils of this stupendous passage; four
others are employed in crossing the sultry plain that stretches its
barren sands from the foot of the mountain to the verdant heights
of Sibbeel, where the wells of water and the chearing view of
multitudes of antelopes suspend their fatigues, and anticipate the
refreshments that await them on the next evening; for the close of
the following day conducts them to the town of Augéla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>From that place,
which is subject to Tripoli, and is famed for the abundance and
excellent flavour of its dates, they proceed in one day to the
little village of Gui Xarrah; another brings them to the long
ascent of the broad mountain of Gerdóbah, from whose inflexible
barrenness the Traveller, in the course of a five days passage, can
only collect a scanty supply of unpalatable water. Descending from
these mournful highlands, he enters the narrow plain of Gegabib,
sandy and uninhabited, yet fertile in dates, which the people of
Duna (a town dependant on Tripoli, and situated on the Coast at the
distance of eight days journey from Gegabib) annually gather.</p>

<p>From this scene of gladsome contrast to the inveterate rocks of
Gerdóbah, a three days march conducts the caravan to another
desolate mountain of the name of Buselema, that furnishes only
water; and in three days more they enter the dominions of the
independent Republic of See-wah.</p>

<p>Governed by a Council of six or eight Elders, whose lasting
dissentions divide the opinions and distract the allegiance of the
people, this unfortunate State is constantly involved in the
miseries of intestine war. Its chief produce is the date tree; for
the lands, though not destitute of water, furnish but little
corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>From See-wah,
the capital, the caravan proceeds in a single day to the miserable
village of Umseguér, which is one of the dependencies of the State,
and is situated at the foot of the mountainous Desart of Le Mágra,
where, in the long course of a seven days passage, the Traveller is
scarcely sensible that a few spots of thin and meagre brushwood
slightly interrupt the vast expanse of sterility, and diminish the
amplitude of desolation. The eighth day terminates with his arrival
at the hill of Huaddy L’Ottrón, which is distinguished by a small
convent, of three Christian Monks, who reside there under the
protection of Cairo, and to whose hospitable entertainment the
Traveller is largely indebted. Buildings, surrounded with high
walls, and erected in the neighbourhood of the convent, are opened
for his reception; and for three successive days, if he chuses to
be their guest so long, his wants, as far as their means extend,
are chearfully and liberally supplied.</p>

<p>Their garden, in which is a well of excellent and never-failing
water, affords an ample store of vegetables of various kinds; the
maintenance of a few sheep is furnished by an adjoining pasture;
and they raise, without difficulty, a numerous breed of fowls. All
other articles, except their bread, which they manufacture
themselves, they receive from Cairo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Respected by the
Arabs, who revere their hospitality more than they hate their
religion, these venerable men are apparently secure.—Yet as too
much confidence might invite the meanest plunderers to invade their
peaceful dwelling, they have cautiously guarded their convent by a
separate and lofty inclosure from an opening in which a ladder of
ropes furnishes the means of descent.</p>

<p>Leaving this hospitable hill with such refreshments as the
generous Fathers could supply, the caravan continues its course,
and on the fifth day arrives at the City of Cairo, from whence, at
the usual season, it proceeds by the customary rout to Mecca.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="xlarge">F</span><span class=
"allcaps">rom</span> the perusal of the preceding account, the
Society are enabled to judge of the credit which it deserves, and
of the value of the information which it offers. If the evidence of
its truth should be thought insufficient, they will keep their
minds in suspence till Narratives of more confirmed authenticity
shall disprove or establish the relation. But if they should think
that the Shereef’s account of Bornou and of the Niger is too
strongly supported by the corresponding description of Ben Alli, to
leave a suspicion of its falsehood; and that the fidelity of this
part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> his
Narrative warrants the belief of whatever else is equally described
on the authority of his personal knowledge, then they will feel
that conclusions of an important and interesting nature result from
the various, though imperfect intelligence which he has
furnished.</p>

<p>The present state of the Empire of Bornou, compared with its
condition when Leo Africanus, who wrote his account in the year
1526, was its visitor, exhibits an interesting proof of the
advancement of the Mahometan Faith, and of the progress of
imperfect civilization.<a id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> A savage nakedness, or the
rude covering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> which
the skins of beasts afford, are now relinquished, for the decency
and convenience of a dress of cotton manufacture. Tempered by the
courtesy of commerce, and the conciliating interchange of important
benefits, the antient barbarism of the people is softened to habits
of kindness; and, in the minds of the greatest part, the absurd
superstitions of Paganism have given place to the natural and
sublime idea of the Unity of God.</p>

<p>From the account of the nations to the <em>South of the
Niger</em>, it appears, that, among the Mahometan Blacks, the
sternness of the Musselman is softened by the mildness of the
Negro; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> that if
the zeal of the invader be not inflamed by the value of the
captive, the propagation of the faith is seldom considered as a
reason or pretext for war.</p>

<p>Perhaps the attention of the <em>Philosopher</em> may be engaged
by the use to which the small shells of the Maldive Islands are
equally applied by the inhabitants of Cashna, and by the natives of
Bengal. Sameness of opinion, or resemblance of conduct, when
founded in natural feeling, or a similar state of society, are seen
without wonder in nations unconnected and remote; but that a custom
so arbitrary and artificial as that of employing Cowries as a
substitute for coin, a custom which instinct could not have
produced, and chance could scarcely have occasioned, should equally
prevail among the Negros of Africa and the natives of Bengal, may
justly be deemed a curious and interesting phenomenon.</p>

<p>To the British <em>Traveller</em>, a desire of exchanging the
usual excursion from Calais to Naples, for a Tour more extended and
important, and of passing from scenes with which all are
acquainted, to researches in which every object is new, and each
step is discovery, may recommend the Kingdom of Fezzan. If
Antiquities be his favourite pursuit, the ruins which shadow
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> cottages of
Jermah and of Temissa, promise an ample gratification: or if the
study of Nature be his wish, the expansive scenes and numerous
productions of that uninvestigated soil may equally promote his
entertainment and his knowledge. But if a spirit of more
adventurous research should induce him to travel with the Merchants
of Fezzan, discoveries of superior value may distinguish and reward
his toil. The powerful Empires of Bornou and Cashna will be open to
his investigation; the luxurious City of Tombuctou, whose opulence
and severe police attract the Merchants of the most distant States
of Africa, will unfold to him the causes of her vast prosperity;
the mysterious Niger will disclose her unknown original and
doubtful termination; and countries unveiled to antient or modern
research will become familiar to his view. Or should he be willing
to join the Cairo Caravan, the discovery of the antient scite, and
of whatever else may remain of the Temple of Jupiter Ammon, may
perhaps be attempted with success: for the same causes which gave
birth to the springs, and, by their means, to the luxuriant
vegetation of the antient domains of the Temple, must still
continue to distinguish the fortunate soil; and there seems no
reason to doubt that the hospitable convent of Huaddy L’Ottrón, or
the neighbouring Republic of See-wah, will not only furnish a place
of convenient departure and of easy retreat, but will also
supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> the
requisite information, and the necessary aid. At this time, an
Interpreter, who is equally acquainted with Arabic and English, may
be found in London; and, at all times, the Cities of Tripoli, of
Tunis, and of Ceuta, afford a number of Mahometans who are almost
as conversant with the Italian or the Spanish, as with the Arabic,
their native language.</p>

<p>But of all the advantages to which a better acquaintance with
the Inland Regions of Africa may lead, the first in importance is,
the extension of the Commerce, and the encouragement of the
Manufactures of Britain. That fire-arms are in request with all
nations, civilized and savage, who have the means of obtaining
them, experience uniformly proves; and we now learn, that to the
jealousy which the Princes on the Southern Coast entertain of the
powerful Interior States, and to the total neglect of all
opportunities of opening, from more favourable quarters, an
immediate communication with the inland country, it is owing that
the sale of one of the most profitable manufactures of Great
Britain is still in a great measure confined to the scanty Tribes
which inhabit the shores of the Atlantic. From the same information
we are also led to conclude, that the anxious policy which
prohibits the conveyance of fire-arms to the Inland Tribes,
dictates, as a necessary caution, the severest
restraints<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span> on the
transit of other merchandize. But if, on the system of the Moors,
the effect of which has been tried too long for its wisdom to be
disputed, associations of Englishmen should form caravans, and take
their departure from the highest navigable reaches of the Gambia,
or from the settlement which is lately established at Sierra Leona,
there is reason to believe, that countries new to the fabrics of
England, and probably inhabited by more than a hundred millions of
people, may be gradually opened to her trade. On this system, much
greater would be their profits than those which the Merchants of
Fezzan receive; for they would reach, by a journey of 700 miles
from their vessels, the same markets to which a land-carriage of
3000 conveys from the Mediterranean the goods of the Fezzanners;
and they would also possess the farther advantage of obtaining at
prime cost, the same articles for which the Merchants of Fezzan are
subjected to the complicated disadvantages of a high price, of an
inferior quality, and of the varying exactions that the despotic
Governments of Barbary impose. Now if it be considered, that
notwithstanding the vast expence of land-carriage, and of an
exorbitant price on the purchase of the articles which they sell,
the Traders of Fezzan are still enabled to collect a profit that
upholds and encourages their commerce, it must be evident, that the
gain which the Merchants of England<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_206">[206]</span> would derive from a similar traffic,
conducted as is here proposed, would be such as few commercial
adventures have ever been found to yield. That no difficulties will
attend the execution of the Plan, the general history of new
undertakings forbids us to believe; but as far as the
<em>climate</em> and <em>religion</em> of the Negros are in
question, there seems to be little discouragement; for the long
descent of the rivers is a proof that the elevation of the inland
country is raised above the level of the coast and consequently
that the climate is much more temperate, and probably more
salubrious: and while the Narrative of the Shereef announces that
the Merchant is considered by the Negro as the general friend of
Mankind, common experience convincingly shews that, in the
judgement of the Pagan, the Crescent and the Cross are objects of
equal indifference; and that the comparative welcome of the
Musselman and of the Christian depends on their Merchandize rather
than their Creed.</p>

<p>As little discouragement is suggested by a view of the
purchasable goods of which the natives are possessed; for,
independently of their cotton, which in all the interior nations is
described as of common manufacture, and therefore as of general
growth, their mines of gold (the improveable possession of many of
the Inland States) will furnish, to an unknown, and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span> probably boundless extent, an
article that commands, in all the markets of the civilized world, a
constant and unlimited sale.</p>

<p>Such are the important objects of mercantile pursuit, which the
various intelligence obtained by the first efforts of the
Association, enables them to point out and recommend to their
Country: and while the contemplation of national interests, and of
the still more extended interests of philosophy, directs their
efforts and animates their hopes, they cannot be indifferent to the
reflection, that in the pursuit of these advantages, and by means
as peaceable as the purposes are just, the conveniencies of civil
life, the benefits of the mechanic and manufacturing arts, the
attainments of science, the energies of the cultivated mind, and
the elevation of the human character, may in some degree be
imparted to nations hitherto consigned to hopeless barbarism and
uniform contempt.</p>

progress towards improvement than that of every other part of the

attributed more to natural causes, than to any absolute want of
attention on the part of Geographers. Formed by the Creator, with a
contour and surface totally unlike the other Continents, its
interior parts elude all nautic research; whilst the wars and
commerce in which Europeans have taken part, have been
confined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span> to very
circumscribed parts of its borders. These most productive means of
geographical information failing, the next resource is to collect
materials from the best informed amongst the travelled
<em>natives</em>: I say <em>natives</em>, because the generality of
European Travellers reckon upon some degree of solace, as well as
the gratification of curiosity, during their peregrinations: not to
mention, that it is more the practice to see what has been already
seen, than to strike into a new path, and dare to contemplate an
unfashionable subject. To the lovers of adventure and novelty,
Africa displays a most ample field: but the qualification of local
manners, and, in some degree, of habits, must in this case, be
superadded to that of language: and this, unquestionably, renders
the undertaking more arduous than that of an ordinary Tour. But the
Adventurer in quest of fame, will readily appreciate the degrees of
glory attendant on each pursuit.</p>

<p>The 18th century has smiled propitiously on the Science of

Englishman may be allowed to pride himself that his countrymen have
had their full share of the glory attending this, and other kinds
of researches tending to increase the general stock of knowledge.
It is to this spirit that we are to attribute the acquisition of
the materials which form the subject of the present Work. It is no
less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span> to this spirit
that we are indebted for the progressive improvements in the
North-American and Asiatic Geography: our systems embracing objects
far superior to the limited views with which Geographical Surveys
are ordinarily undertaken: not the topography of townships,
districts, counties; but the Geography of Empires, Regions, and
Continents!</p>

<p>As both <span class="gs">Europe</span>, and its adjacent

inland seas, lakes, or rivers of the most extended navigations, so
as collectively to aid the transport of bulky articles of
merchandize from one extreme of them to the other; and to form
(like stepping-stones over a brook) a more commodious
communication: so likewise the northern part of the new Continent
appears to have an almost continuous Inland Navigation, which must
prove of infinite advantage to the inhabitants, when fully peopled;
and contribute to their speedier civilization, in the mean time.
But Africa stands alone in a geographical view! Penetrated by no
inland seas, like the Mediterranean, Baltic, or Hudson’s Bay; nor
overspread with extensive lakes, like those of North America; nor
having in common with the other Continents, rivers running from the
center to the extremities: but, on the contrary, its regions
separated from each other by the least practicable of all
boundaries, arid Desarts of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_214">[214]</span> such formidable extent, as to threaten
those who traverse them, with the most horrible of all deaths, that
arising from thirst! Placed in such circumstances, can we be
surprised either at our ignorance of its Interior Parts, or of the
tardy progress of civilization in it? Possibly, the difficulty of
conveying merchandize to the coasts, under the above circumstances,
may have given rise to the <em>traffic</em> in <em>men</em>, a
commodity that can transport itself! But laying this out of the
question, as an abstract speculation, there can be little doubt but
that the progress of civilization amongst the Africans has been as
slow as can be conceived, in any situation: and it has also
happened, of course, that the destined Instruments of their
civilization have remained in a proportional degree of ignorance
concerning the nature of the country.</p>

<p>Nothing can evince the low state of the African Geography, more
than M. D’Anville’s having had recourse to the Works of
<span class="gs">Ptolomy</span> and <span class="gs">Edrisi</span>,
to compose the Interior Part of his Map of Africa (1749.) It is
well known, that those Authors wrote in the second and in the
twelfth centuries of our æra. Most of the positions in the Inland
Part of the great body of Africa are derived from <span class=
"gs">Edrisi</span>; and it is wonderful how nearly some of the
positions agree with those furnished by the present
materials.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> Such was
the transcendant judgement of D’Anville in combining the scanty
notices that are furnished by the Nubian Geographer!</p>

<p>But the Public are not to expect, even under an improved system
of African Geography, that the Interior Part of that Continent will
exhibit an aspect similar to the others; rich in variety; each
region assuming a distinct character. On the contrary, it will be
meagre and vacant in the extreme. The dreary expanses of desart
which often surround the habitable spots, forbid the appearance of
the usual proportion of towns; and the paucity of rivers, added to
their being either absorbed or evaporated, instead of being
conducted in flowing lines to the ocean, will give a singular cast
to its hydrography; the direction of their courses being, moreover,
equivocal, through the want of that information, which a
communication with the sea usually affords at a glance. Little as
the Antients knew of the Interior Part of Africa, they appear to
have understood the character of its surface; one of them comparing
it to a leopard’s skin. Swift also, who loses no opportunity of
being witty at the expence of mathematicians, diverts himself and
his readers both with the <em>nakedness</em> of the land, and the
absurdity of the map-makers.</p>

<p>The Society for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of
Africa has been fortunate in collecting much geographical
information, in so early a stage of the African researches; and
there is little doubt but that in a few years all the great
features of this Continent (within the reach of their enquiries)
may be known and described. But to accomplish this, it will be
necessary that intelligent Europeans should trace some of the
principal routes; as well to apportion the distances, as to
establish some kind of criterion for the parole information derived
from the natives. As yet, in the wide extent of near thirty degrees
on a meridian, between <span class="gs">Benin</span> and
<span class="gs">Tripoli</span>, not one celestial observation has
been taken, to determine the latitude.</p>

<p>But as far as materials composed by a scale founded on estimated
distances (that is, days journeys of caravans) may go towards the
establishment of geographical positions, the itineraries made use
of for constructing the new matter in the accompanying map, are
less discordant than might be expected in so wide an expanse, and
on the foundation of rules so vague as those<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_217">[217]</span> which necessity has compelled me to
apply. On this, however, the Reader must exercise his own
judgement, after the following exposition of the <em>data</em>, and
the rules by which I have determined the scale.</p>

<p>It will easily be conceived by the Reader, that all roads,
except such as are made through a country, in which the public
works are in the highest state of improvement, and where also the
face of it is perfectly level (the curvature of the earth excepted)
must have some degree of inflexion, both horizontally and
vertically; and either of these will occasion a Traveller to trace
a line of greater length by the road, than can be measured on a
straight line, drawn from the point of commencement, to that of the
termination of his journey. The quantity of the difference must
vary with the nature of the country; but in ordinary cases, still
more with the extent of the line of distance: for a different ratio
between the road distance and horizontal distance must obtain, as
the line of distance is increased. Let it be admitted, that in
stages of ten or twelve miles, the winding of the road occasions a
loss of only one-tenth part, which may be termed the
<em>simple</em> winding: yet as the different stages in an extent
of 100 or 150 miles, do not lie in a straight line, drawn through
the whole extent, but often very far to the right and left of
it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> a
<em>compound</em> winding arises: and I have found by long
experience, that one mile in eight must be deducted, to reduce the
road measure, on such a length, to horizontal measure. When a line
of distance is extended to 500 miles and upwards, the rule becomes
much more vague than when applied to moderate distances; because it
often happens (and more particularly in unimproved countries) that
obstacles present themselves, and give an entire new direction to
the course of the road; although the two parts of it, considered
separately, may have only an ordinary degree of crookedness.
However, as some of the lines of distance applied to the present
subject, are from thirty to forty days journey, it becomes
necessary that some general rules should be adopted. It happens
that examples are furnished, in two cases, on very long journies,
where the real distances between the terminating points of the
routes are nearly known: such is that of fifty-three days journey,
between the Capital of <em>Fezzan</em> and <em>Cairo</em>; and the
mean horizontal distance for each day, is fourteen and a half
geographic miles, or those of sixty to a degree. I confess I should
have expected much less. The other example is between
<em>Arguin</em> and <em>Gallam</em>: there forty days produce
thirteen miles for each day; and this is conformable to my
expectations. In the examples of small distances, such as six days
journey, sixteen miles per day is the result, and is
consistent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> For a
caravan journey, taken at twenty-two British miles of <em>road</em>
distance, will produce, when the allowance for winding is deducted,
and the remainder reduced to geographic miles, about sixteen and a
half such miles for a single day.</p>

<p>The following are the proportions which I have established, for
the application of a scale, to the different degrees of
distance.</p>

<p>For one day, sixteen miles and a half; for seventeen to
twenty-five days, fifteen miles; for forty to fifty days, thirteen
miles. These numbers are particularly selected, because they
occurred in the course of the Work. The Reader will be pleased to
observe, that the miles spoken of in the construction, are always
those of sixty to a degree of a great circle. However tedious this
investigation may appear to the generality of readers, it is
absolutely necessary; as it is the hinge upon which the whole
turns: and a neglect of attention to this particular subject, would
warrant the Reader’s taking the whole for granted, without further
examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="gs">Beaufoy</span> having given, from the
materials in his possession, so full an account of each road and
country, nothing remains<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_220">[220]</span> for me to do, but simply to describe, from
the same materials, the mode of fixing the principal positions, in
the Map. As the object of it is to exhibit the new matter only,
care has been taken to exclude all that has already appeared,
except what was absolutely necessary towards explaining the other:
and as the borrowed particulars are distinguished from the rest,
the Reader cannot be mistaken. The outline of the great body of
Africa, together with the courses of the Nile, Gambia, Senegal, and
Wad-drah, are copied from Mr. D’Anville.</p>

<p>Fezzan (or rather its capital, Mourzouk) is given in the
Itineraries at the distance of seventeen days and half from
Mesurata. These, taken at fifteen miles per day, produce two
hundred and sixty-two miles. The bearing is said to be South from
Mourzouk; and this latter is placed according to D’Anville.
Mourzouk, then, falls in latitude 27° 20′.</p>

<p>Agadez, the next principal station, is, at a medium forty-one
days from Mourzouk, on a South West course, or thereabouts: and
these, at thirteen miles per day, produce four hundred and
fifty-five miles; and place Agadez in latitude 20° 20′; and nearly
in the meridian of Tripoli. Agadez is the Agadost of Edrisi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>From Agadez to
Cashna is seventeen days; which, at fifteen miles per day, give a
distance of two hundred and fifty-five miles. The bearing is said
to be South South West. Cashna, then, will stand in or about the
latitude of 16° 20′ North, and about a degree and half West from
Tripoli.</p>

<p>D’Anville’s <em>Casseenah</em> (undoubtedly meant for Cashna) is
placed about thirty-seven miles to the North West of the position
assumed in the accompanying Map; whence I consider mine as a near
approximation, especially as the distance from Mesurata is upwards
of nine hundred and seventy miles.</p>

<p>Cashna may be regarded as the central kingdom of the great body
of Africa; and as a part of the region named <span class=
"gs">Soudan</span>, of which at present but few particulars are
known.</p>

<p>Ghanah, or Ghinnah, is placed, in respect of Cashna, according
to M. D’Anville’s Map. It does not appear whether he had any
authority for placing it ninety miles to the North East of Cashna:
but its position, in respect of the City of Nuabia, (antiently
Meroé, on the Nile) is on the authority of Edrisi. This Author also
allows twelve days between Agadez and Ghanah: and by my
construction, they are two hundred and eight miles<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span> asunder. See <em>Geog.
Nubiensis</em>, p. 39. Ghanah was in the twelfth century a city of
the first consequence. Wangara and Kanem, were also known to
Edrisi.</p>

<p>The river known to Europeans by the name of <span class=
"gs">Niger</span>, runs on the South of the kingdom of Cashna, in
its course towards Tombuctou; and if the report which Ben Alli
heard in that town, may be credited, it is afterwards lost in the
sands on the South of the country of Tombuctou. In the Map, only
the known part of its course is marked by a line; and the
suppositious part by dots. It may be proper to observe, that the
Africans have two names for this river; that is, <span class=
"gs">Neel il Abeed</span>, or <span class="gs">River of the
Negros</span>; and <span class="gs">Neel il Kibeer</span>, or
<span class="gs">the Great River</span>. They also term the
<span class="gs">Nile</span>, (that is, the Egyptian River)
<span class="gs">Neel Shem</span>: so that the term <span class=
"gs">Neel</span>, from whence our <span class="gs">Nile</span>, is
nothing more than the appellative of River; like <span class=
"gs">Ganges</span>, or <span class="gs">Sinde</span>.</p>

<p>From Cashna the road leads Westward to the Kingdom of
<span class="gs">Gonjah</span>, ninety-seven days journey from the
former. <em>Gonjah</em>, is, from circumstances, the
<em>Conche</em> of M. D’Anville, and the <em>Gonge</em> of M.
Delisle; and the similitude of names, however great, is the least
proof it: for the Itinerary of the <span class="gs">Shereef
Imhammed</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
says, that eighteen or twenty days from Gonjah, towards the North
West (or between the West and North) lies the Country of
<span class="gs">Yarba</span>: and eight days farther West, that of
<span class="gs">Affow</span>. Now the countries of <span class=
"gs">Yarra</span> and <span class="gs">Yaffon</span>, will be found
in Delisle’s Map of Senegal (1726), nearly in the position that
<em>Yarba</em> and <em>Affow</em> take in respect of Gonjah;
supposing D’Anville’s <em>Conche</em> to be meant for it. It is
extremely difficult to assign a ratio for the decrease of the
horizontal distance, on so extended a line as ninety-seven days
journey; and therefore it would be losing time to attempt it.
Gonjah, by circumstances, is about eight hundred and seventy miles
from Cashna, which allows only nine miles for each day. I therefore
conclude that the road is very circuitous.</p>

<p>Gonjah is reported by the Shereef to be forty-six days journey
from the Coast of Guinea, to which the Christians trade. It is
probable that the Gold Coast is the part meant, and that may be
taken at five hundred and thirty miles from D’Anville’s Conché. The
ratio, at thirteen per day, would give near six hundred. Here
again, it would be losing of time, to reason on such a point of
uncertainty, since neither of the extreme points of the line of
distance are correctly known. The Reader must therefore determine
for himself. Of this space of forty-six<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_224">[224]</span> days travelling, from Gonjah towards the
Coast, the Shereef had travelled only the first ten days, to the
City of Kalanshee, a dependency of the Kingdom of
<em>Tounouwah</em>; the capital of which, according to his report,
is <span class="gs">Assentai</span> (the Assianté of D’Anville)
situated midway between Kalanshee and the sea coast: that is,
eighteen days journey from each. The Shereef also reports, that
there is no communication between this coast (which we may suppose
to be the Gold Coast) and the country of Gonjah: for that the King
of Assentai, who possesses the space between, prohibits his Inland
Neighbours from passing through his country.</p>

<p>But Mr. <span class="gs">Norris</span>, a gentleman who resided
many years in Whydah, &amp;c. reports differently: for he says,
that there are other States, (that is, the Fantees, and their
confederates) lying between Assentai and the sea; and that the
Assentais have often attempted, but without success, to open a
communication with the Coast.</p>

<p>To return to the route from Cashna to Gonjah. There are between
them some extensive kingdoms or states, most of which appear to
preserve their antient religion. I have generally marked the
progress of the Mahomedan Religion, by a crescent; and the Caffre
States by an arbitrary mark of a different kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>It will appear
by a slight inspection of the Map, that the Mahomedan Religion, as
far as respects the Interior Part of the Country, has spread
southward, to about the parallel of twelve degrees of North
latitude. Probably though, in some of those countries where the
Court religion is Mahomedan, the bulk of the people may profess the
antient religion.</p>

<p><span class="gs">Tombuctou</span>, is placed on the following
authorities: First, Mr. <span class="gs">Matra</span>, the British
Consul in the dominions of Morocco, says, on the authority of the
natives, that Tombuctou is fifty days <em>caravan travelling</em>
from <span class="gs">Tattah</span>, a place situated on the common
frontiers of Morocco, Drah, and Zenhaga; and in the route from
Morocco, and Suz, to Tombuctou. Tattah is ascertained in position,
by a route of Ben Alli’s. He found it to be nine days and half from
Morocco, and one day short of a station on the Wad-drah (or Drah
River) which station was four days, or sixty-six miles lower down
than <em>Tinjuleen</em>, a place in D’Anville’s and Delisle’s Maps
of Africa. It was also twelve days journey from the City of Nun or
Non, which city by Ben Alli’s account, is two days from the sea
coast; and well known to be opposite to the Cape of the same name.
These authorities enable us to place Tattah one hundred and seventy
miles South South East from Morocco. Then, fifty days from Tattah
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span> Tombuctou, at
thirteen each day, produces six hundred and fifty miles. By Ben
Alli’s report, Tombuctou is forty-eight days from the capital of
Sultan Fullan, lying within the district of Gallam, on the River
Senegal. The position of this place is not known to me; but by
circumstances it must be near the river: and in using materials of
so coarse a kind, trifles must not be regarded. Forty-eight days at
thirteen each day, produce six hundred and twenty miles; and this
line of distance meets that from Tattah, in latitude 19°. 40′. and
nearly midway between Gallam and Cashna. In this position, it falls
only twenty-eight miles to the North West of D’Anville’s
Tombuctou.</p>

<p>It appears that most of the road from Tattah to Tombuctou, lies
across the vast Desart, commonly known by the name of <span class=
"gs">Zahara</span>, or properly, <span class="gs">The
Desart</span>. Geography is at present, very bare of particulars,
in this quarter. Ben Alli went from Tombuctou, direct to Fezzan,
skirting the South East border of this great Desart. He reckoned
only sixty-four days between Tombuctou and Fezzan, which at twelve
miles and half per day, produce only eight hundred miles. The
interval on the Map is nine hundred and seventy. Reason, however,
points out, that the distance from the nearest place, Gallam, ought
to be preferred. And as it is understood, that Agadez and
Tombuctou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> are about
fifty-five days asunder, it appears yet more probable that the
interval between Fezzan and Tombuctou, ought not to be reduced. It
must be recollected, that Ben Alli’s Communications were given from
memory, after an interval of twenty years.</p>

<p>The point of the next importance, is Bornou, the capital of an
extensive kingdom situated on the South East of Fezzan, and between
the two <span class="gs">Neels</span> or <span class=
"gs">Niles</span>; that of Egypt, and that of the Negros.</p>

<p>Bornou, is given by the Shereef, at about fifty days from
Mourzouk (or Fezzan) which may be taken at six hundred and fifty
miles. He also reports that it is twenty-five days journey from the
course of the Nile, where it passes the country of Sennar; or in
distance about three hundred and sixty miles. This would place
Bornou in a direction of South East, somewhat southwardly, from
Mourzouk; and about the parallel of 19° 40′. It is not probable
that Bornou has a more westerly position. Edrisi’s account would
place it more easterly; for he says, that <em>Matthan</em>, a city
of <em>Kanem</em>, lies thirty-one days from <em>Nuabia</em> (on
the Nile) through <em>Tegua</em>. <em>Geog. Nub.</em> p. 15.
Edrisi’s day’s journey is equal to eighteen Arabic miles, or nearly
nineteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> geographic
ones: consequently the thirty-one days give five hundred and
eighty-seven miles. Matthan is not reported in the Itinerary; but
Kanem is, both as Province and a capital City: and the position of
the latter according to my construction, is seven hundred miles
from Nuabia. Whether the error lies on the side of Edrisi, or the
Shereef; or arises from the faulty position of Nuabia in D’Anville,
cannot easily be discovered.</p>

<p>Ben Alli travelled the road between Bornou and Alexandria; but
was too much indisposed to make any observations, otherwise than
that the Kingdom of Bornou extends fifteen days journey, or about
two hundred and thirty miles, in that direction. This was
particularly unfortunate; for whichsoever route he went, he must
have crossed some one or more of the <span class="gs">Oases</span>;
and of course some important matter would have been added to the
Map.</p>

<p>The only route of importance that remains to be discussed, is
that from Fezzan or Mourzouk, to Cairo, leading to Mecca; for, at
Mourzouk the Mahomedans from the southern and western parts of
Africa, who intend to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, assemble at the
proper season, as at a common point of departure. The route to
Cairo, which requires fifty-three days to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_229">[229]</span> atchieve, appears on the Map to be seven
hundred and seventy miles; being equal to fourteen and half for
each day: and is on the whole, seventy more than I should have
expected that number of days to produce. To what degree of accuracy
the difference of longitude between Mesurata and Cairo, is
ascertained, I am ignorant: as also whether the bearing of Mourzouk
from Mesurata, be right. Fourteen miles and half of horizontal
distance for each day, on so long a line of distance, and on so
rugged a way as the Itinerary describes, is too great a proportion;
and we may suspect an error somewhere.</p>

<p>A circumstance occurs in the Itinerary, which would determine
how near this route approaches to the Coast of the Mediterranean
Sea; if we might depend on the accuracy of the Itinerist. The dates
produced in the Plain of <em>Gegabib</em>, are gathered by the
people of <em>Duna</em>, who inhabit the sea coast, eight days
journey off; or about one hundred and thirty miles. No such place
as <em>Duna</em> appears in the modern maps; but <em>Derna</em>
(antiently <em>Darnis</em>) does: and it is situated within the
confines of Tripoli, as Duna is said to be. But the distance must
be faulty; because <em>Augela</em> is the nearest point in this
route, to Derna, though ten days from it: and <em>Gegabib</em>, is
seven days from Augela, in a direction that still increases the
distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>Augela is found
in Herodotus, Book IV. under the name of <em>Ægila</em>; and in
Ptolemy and Pliny it is written <em>Augila</em>. In Ptolemy, Africa
Tab. III. it is placed about 197 miles from the sea coast, and
about a degree of longitude to the eastward of <em>Darnis</em>. Its
longitudinal position from Mourzouk and Cairo, agrees very well:
and considering the extent of Ptolemy’s local knowledge in this
quarter, we may suppose him well acquainted with its distance from
the coast. Allowance must be made for an excess of distance given
by Ptolemy’s scale, in this Map; and it being in the proportion of
twenty-seven to twenty-three, the one hundred and ninety-seven
miles should be reduced to one hundred and sixty-eight: and
according to this, Augela ought to stand in latitude 29° 20′; and
nearly midway between Mourzouk and Cairo.</p>

<p>Gegabib, as has been said before, is seven days journey from
Augela, towards Cairo; and as I have a particular pleasure in
producing any authority that serves to prove the veracity of such
an Author as <span class="gs">Herodotus</span>, I shall just
mention, that (in B. IV.) he says, that the <em>Nasamones</em> in
the Summer season, leave their cattle on the coast, and go to the
plains of Ægila, to gather the fruit of the Palm trees, which
abound in that place. The portion of this coast, is marked by its
lying on the West of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_231">[231]</span> Teuchira,<a id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> a sea-port that lay within
the district of <em>Cyrene</em>, now better known by the names of
Curin and Barca.</p>

<p>Ptolemy’s Nasamones, occupy, in respect of <em>Augila</em>, the
very spot where the dates are now gathered in the plain of
<em>Gegabib</em>: and therefore we may conclude that the Nasamones’
Territories extended at least from that plain, to the Eastern Coast
of the Great Syrtis. It may, perhaps, in future, be known where the
Port or Coast of Duna is; whether it be Derna, the antient Darnis,
or some place on the Syrtis.</p>

<p>Between <em>Augela</em> and <em>See-wah</em>, the next town
towards Cairo (and probably the <em>Siropum</em> of Ptolemy) the
road passes over a chain of very high mountains, named in these
times <em>Gerdobah</em>: and this is unquestionably the same ridge
that terminates on the Mediterranean, a few days journey farther
on; and which by the suddenness of its descent towards the sea, was
antiently named <em>Catabathmus</em>. This chain or ridge divided
<em>Cyrene</em> from <em>Marmarica</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>The scite of the
antient Temple of <em>Jupiter Ammon</em>, was a few days journey
(perhaps four or five) inland from the plain of Gegabib, so often
mentioned. I think I may venture to say this on the authority of
Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny, and Arrian; from each of whom, some
particulars may be collected respecting its situation. First,
Herodotus says, (Book IV.) that the Temple is situated ten days
from <em>Ægila</em>; (frequented by the Nasamones on account of the
dates) and on the road from Thebes to <em>Ægila</em>. Next, Arrian
says, on the authority of Aristobulus, that Alexander went to it,
from the scite of his new city of Alexandria, along the sea coasts
of Egypt and Marmarica, to <em>Paraetonium</em>: which latter was
situated, according to the same authority, sixteen hundred stadia
from Alexandria. Pliny gives it at two hundred Roman miles (Book
V.) These accounts are perfectly conclusive; and the position of
<em>Paraetonium</em>, is also very clear in Ptolemy; and is
moreover known to the Moderns under the name of <em>Al
Bareton</em>: so that no difficulty can arise here. Arrian says
farther, that Alexander struck inland from <em>Paraetonium</em>,
and entered the Desart: but he does not say how far the Temple lay
from the sea coast. This is supplied by Strabo, (Book XXVII.) who
gives the distance at thirteen hundred stadia. Allowing these to
produce one hundred and thirty, or one hundred and forty miles; and
taking Herodotus’s ten days<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_233">[233]</span> from Augela at one hundred and seventy (we
must not consider them as <em>caravan</em> journies, but as
<em>ordinary</em> ones) the meeting of these lines of distance,
place the Temple in latitude twenty-nine degrees, and a small
fraction; and in a South Westerly direction from Parætonium. Pliny
says, (Book V.) that the Temple is four hundred [Roman] miles from
Cyrene; that is, twice as far as Parætonium is from Alexandria: and
this agrees with the former position. Lastly, Ptolemy places it one
hundred and ninety-five geographic miles from <em>Paraetonium</em>;
and from <em>Cyrene</em> three hundred and forty.—But Ptolemy’s
scale, in Africa Tab. III. gives too much distance (as I have said
before), and corrected, it should be one hundred and sixty-six from
Parætonium. As these authorities do not vary amongst themselves
more than thirty miles, I consider them as conclusive.</p>

<p>M. D’Anville’s position of this Temple is about thirty miles
farther to the Southward; that is, from the Mediterranean; but he
does not quote his authorities. In his <em>Geographie Ancienne
Abregee</em>, vol. iii. p. 42. he has the following passage: “Selon
la Géographie actuelle, ce qu’on trouve sous le nom de
<em>Sant-rieh</em>, paroit en tenir la place; & par la Nature du
pays, qui ne laisse point distinguer d’autre objet, on n’est point
embarrassé sur le choix.” Edrisi (<em>Geo. Nub.</em> p. 41.) places
<em>Sant-rie</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
ten days Eastward from Augela, and nine days from the
Mediterranean; which carries Sant-rie farther from the sea-coast,
than Strabo allows to the Temple; but accords with Ptolemy. Savary,
vol. ii. Lett. VIII.) quotes Abulfeda, to shew that the
<em>Oases</em> were only three days journey West of the Nile; and
Ptolemy places the largest of them, named <span class="gs">El
Wah</span> by the Arabs, under the parallel of 27°. I suspect
Abulfeda is wrong; and that Ptolemy is nearer the truth, when he
allows one hundred and twenty-three miles, (or one hundred and five
corrected) for the distance of the Great Oasis from Ptolemais on
the Nile, in the direction of West, something Southwardly. Then
Edrisi allows only nine days between Sant-rie and El Wah; whereas
the scite of the Temple of Jupiter Ammon, by the above authorities,
should be, according to my apprehension, at least twelve days from
<span class="gs">El Wah</span>. But we are young in African
Geography: and as I have said before, the <em>data</em> furnished
by Arrian, Strabo, and Pliny, may satisfy us.</p>

<p>The description of the <em>Oasis</em> (or Island in the midst of
the sandy Desart) which contained the Temple, is pretty generally
known: but for the sake of those who may not recollect the
particulars, I have extracted the following account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>Arrian says,
that it is not more than forty stadia in extent; Diodorus fifty;
say, six or seven miles. All accounts agree, that it has one or
more fountains of water; and that it was planted with divers kinds
of fruit trees: Arrian particularly notices the Palm and Olive.
What appeared to be a very great natural curiosity, was, a
fountain, which according to Arrian, (whose account is the least
extravagant) varied in its temperature, in a greater degree than
any other that has been heard of: that is, it was very warm, or
hot, at midnight; very cold in the heat of the day. I presume these
phenomena will not appear very extraordinary to those, who
consider, that a deep-seated spring will preserve a mean degree of
temperature at all seasons: so that, in effect, it was the
atmosphere that underwent the change; and with it, the bodies of
those who made the observations.</p>

<p>The Temple was surrounded by a triple wall, forming three
distinct quarters or divisions; one of which was appropriated to
the use of the Monarch. In the time of Herodotus, when probably the
Temple was in its glory, the dominions of the Ammonites reached
within ten days journey of the City of Thebes: the people were a
colony of Egyptians and Ethiopians, and spoke a mixed language,
(Herod. Book III.) Ammon, or Hammon, was the Egyptian name of
Jupiter; and the image of the god,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_236">[236]</span> similar to that at Thebes; that is, it had
the head of a Ram. (Book IV.)</p>

<p>In the time of Strabo, about four hundred and fifty years after
Herodotus, the Temple was almost deserted; as the Oracle was grown
out of fashion.</p>

<p>It is probable that some remains either of the triple wall, or
of the Temple, may be found at this day; although the materials may
have undergone a different kind of arrangement. The transport of
the materials across the Desart could only have been accomplished
by the strong impulse of superstition: and being once collected,
nothing but a like cause could remove them. See-wah appears to be
the nearest town to this Oasis; and is probably not more than six
days journey on the North East of it: the spring, together with the
ruins of the Temple, and the triple wall, might ascertain the spot,
if the curiosity of the present age demanded it.</p>

that in proceeding from Fezzan to Gharien, on his way to Tripoli,

individual in the caravan was obliged to carry a gun, a brace of
pistols, and a yatagan or sabre. He describes the country as
partially cultivated; and remarks, that it is furnished with few
springs, and is wholly destitute of rivers.</p>

<p>By his account, the distance from Fezzan to Gharien is that of a
journey of sixteen days.</p>

Alli</span> <em>pursued from Fezzan to Bornou is not distinctly
described.</em></p>

<p><em>His relation is, that on the 26th day from the time of his
leaving Fezzan, he arrived at a place which in Arabic is called
Wéddan, or the Rivers, for Wéddan is the plural of Wed which
signifies a river.</em>
</p>

<p><em>The first part of the country through which he passed is
represented as a sandy Desart, in which the Shé (a plant that
resembles the Wild Thyme of England) and a few bushes of shrubs and
short trees are thinly scattered, and wells of water are extremely
rare. Wandering Arabs, of the powerful but hospitable Tribes of
Booaish and Duhassin, appear to be its only inhabitants; and Wéddan
itself is said to contain but 130 houses, which are built of earth
and sand; and to furnish no articles of trade but dates and salt;
yet the country around it is called prolific: the rice grounds are
described as numerous, and multitudes of sheep and goats, of camels
and of horses, swell the list of its possessions.</em>
</p>

<p><em>He represents the Duhassin Arabs, as Merchants journeying to
Bornou, who carried with them for sale an assortment of goods;
among which he enumerates wheat, barley, dates, salt, tobacco, and
alhaiks: and he observes, that he purchased from the Chief the
permission of accompanying the Tribe, and the consequent assurance
of a safe passage to Bornou.</em>
</p>

<p><em>From Wéddan, by forced marches, they arrived in twenty days
at Bornou. A desart of sand, in some places interrupted by woods,
and occasionally watered with rivulets of a strong mineral taste,
constitutes the general description of the country. But as he
entered the kingdom of the Bornoos, the limit of which he
represents as seven days distant from the capital, he passed
through several poor villages of Blacks, who live upon the charity
of Travellers; for though there be no regular marked road, yet the
caravans always take the same rout, and pass by those villages both
in going and returning.</em>
</p>

<p><span class="gs">Ben Alli</span> <em>seems to have travelled
from Mourzouk to Bornou by a different rout from that which is
usually taken by the Merchants of Fezzan: nor can it be supposed,
that the independent and powerful Arabs with whom he journeyed,
would either obtain, or solicit the permission of the Sovereign of
Fezzan to pass in so large a body through his small and unguarded
dominions. And though the corresponding accounts that are given in
the narratives of the Shereef and of</em> <span class="gs">Ben
Alli</span>, <em>of some villages of miserable Blacks, may suggest
an idea that the two roads intersected each other on the frontier
of Bornou, yet as on that supposition, the different times within
which the several parts of the two journeys were respectively
performed cannot be easily reconciled, there is reason to believe
that the villages described by</em> <span class="gs">Ben
Alli</span>, <em>though peopled by similar inhabitants, may not be
the same with those which attracted the compassionate notice of the
Shereef.</em></p>
